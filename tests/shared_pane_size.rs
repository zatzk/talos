//! Two talos instances on one tmux server must not fight over a pane's size.
//!
//! Each instance matches a pane to the rect it paints it into, and both used to
//! do it unconditionally: whichever painted last — including a toast appearing
//! and taking a row — resized the shared window, the agent re-wrapped, and the
//! other instance went on parsing the agent's output into a grid of its own,
//! different size. Measured with two instances of 100×30 and 160×45 on one
//! server: twelve SIGWINCHes in twelve seconds of alternating rect changes, the
//! agent bouncing between 26×73 and 41×118.
//!
//! What must hold instead (`tmux_compat::Server::resize`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`):
//!
//! - an instance painting a different rect does not move a pane another
//!   instance is sizing;
//! - every instance's grid is the pane's real size, so the one that is not
//!   sizing renders the same screen rather than a re-wrapped one;
//! - input is what hands the size over: the instance typed into takes it;
//! - and so is focus: a pane gaining the focus in an instance takes its size
//!   before anything is typed, while a pane that merely keeps the focus does
//!   not take it back, or two instances focused on it would trade it forever;
//! - an instance left alone sizes freely again, with no flap on the way.
//!
//! Two `TmuxBackend`s in one process are two control-mode clients, which is
//! exactly what two talos instances are to the tmux server. Skipped when tmux
//! is absent.
