//! One session, one window per role — and a server already holding two.
//!
//! A restart kills the session's window and then spawns its replacement, and
//! in between the session is indistinguishable from one whose agent died —
//! which is exactly what a repairer relaunches (the interface's
//! `respawn_missing_agents`, a peer's `restart --if-missing`, extension
//! self-heal). Both then spawn and stamp, and the pair they leave is what
//! ADR-25 cannot answer: `stamped_match` returns `Located::Unknown` for two
//! windows carrying one stamp, so the session can no longer be sent to,
//! killed, captured or renamed (issue #1207).
//!
//! Two halves are asserted here and they are not the same claim. The stamp
//! paths **retire** the loser, so the pair is never left behind; and a pair a
//! server is already carrying — which no prevention reaches, because those
//! windows exist — is repaired the first time something tries to act on the
//! session. What is *not* done is teaching the resolver to pick one of two:
//! `the_listing_itself_still_refuses_a_pair` is the guard on that, and it is
//! the reason the repair is a write rather than a reading.
//!
//! Driven against a real tmux server on a private socket: the invariant is
//! about what the server holds, and nothing in-process stands in for it.
