//! What the shipped hook payloads report across a whole turn, not per event.
//!
//! The regression these guard: an agent fires a notification when it asks for
//! permission, and the payload turns that into `blocked` — but nothing put the
//! session back to `working` once the permission was granted. The next signal
//! was the *following* tool call, so a session that was told to go ahead stayed
//! red for the whole tool run (a long build, a test suite), and for a turn that
//! granted its last permission and then only wrote text, right up to the end.
//! A per-event assertion cannot see this: every single event maps to the right
//! state, and only the sequence is wrong.
//!
//! No agent has an "approved" event, so the edge back is whatever each one says
//! first once the prompt is answered — the tool completing, or (opencode) the
//! permission reply itself. Each is a real event name, verified against the
//! installed CLI rather than assumed.
//!
//! For the JSON payloads the hook commands are *run*, in order, with the event
//! body the agent would pipe in on stdin — claude's `case "$(cat)"` matcher
//! included, since whether a body reads as a permission prompt is half the
//! behaviour. A payload's own `matcher` key is the one thing here that is
//! modelled rather than executed: it selects which groups run, because it is
//! the agent and not the shell that applies it ([`matcher_applies`]). The
//! `talos-cli` they call is a stub that records the state
//! word. The script payloads (opencode, pi, omp) are run too, under Node's
//! own (type-stripped for the two TypeScript ones) ESM loader: each is
//! imported for real and driven through its actual `pi.on`/`TalosStatus`
//! registration, with only the one thing outside the module's own control —
//! `pi`'s injected API, or opencode's shell tag — stood in for. The `pi`/`omp`
//! stand-in still runs `report()`'s real `exec()` against the same stub
//! `talos-cli`, on `PATH`, that the JSON turns use.
