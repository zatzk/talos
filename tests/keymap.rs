//! v2's keymap against v1's, chord for chord.
//!
//! v1's defaults are data — `Action::default_chords_for` — so this does not
//! restate them in a list of its own where it can be avoided: it walks v1's own
//! table and asks the v2 registry what each chord does. A key v1 hands to the
//! agent in a focused terminal (`Action::terminal_passthrough`) has to be
//! handed over here too, or the agent's line editing quietly stops working the
//! day the pane it belongs to lands.
//!
//! The bundled plugins are loaded exactly as the binary loads them, so this
//! fails if a plugin drops a chord as readily as if the kernel does.
