-- EDITED: kept as it was at v2.22.4.
-- The central terminal pane: the agent's terminal and a shell, as two TABS of
-- one pane.
--
-- This is the pane that made "everything is a plugin" worth arguing about: it
-- shows a LIVE terminal, which cannot round-trip through Lua tables at 20fps.
--
-- The resolution is that `surface` is a NODE KIND, not a kernel pane. This
-- plugin places and frames it, decides which session it shows, and owns the key
-- rules; the kernel only fills the rect with cells. Lua does not paint a
-- `list`'s glyphs either — same deal.
--
-- The two views are ONE plugin because that is what v1 is: `CentralTab` selects
-- a view of a single pane, and the strip that selects it is drawn on that
-- pane's border. Modelling them as two plugins taking turns in the `switch`
-- slot cost the strip on every tab but the agent's, a second stop in the focus
-- ring, and a slot arbitration that existed only to referee them
-- (v2-system-modals D4).
--
-- Replace this file and you have replaced the central pane.
--
-- The chrome here is an ordinary kernel `frame`. It was drawn by hand for as
-- long as a frame could not express the three things v1's terminal pane needs:
-- a RIGHT-aligned border title, a STYLED one (the focused badge is
-- inverted_fg-on-accent), and a scrollbar overlaid on the right border column
-- so it costs zero content columns. `title_align`, styled title runs and
-- `frame.overlay` are each of those, so the border is one table again and the
-- surface keeps the whole inner rect.

--- value, a chip naming its select action, and a branch beside the surface in
--- `render` returning the diff body — after which the strip covers it for the
--- same reason it now covers the shell.
--- Is the companion shell available at all?
