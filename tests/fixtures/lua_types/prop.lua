-- A pane that misspells a node prop: `txet` where the kind needs `text`.

-- `convert.rs` drops a key it does not know — that is how a plugin carries its
-- own bookkeeping on the node table — so this renders an empty line at runtime
-- and says nothing. The type definitions are what turn it into a finding.
