//! A test run leaves no tmux server behind.
//!
//! talos injects `TALOS_SOCKET` **and** `TALOS_SOCKET_FOR` into every
//! pane it spawns, so a suite run from inside a talos session — which is how
//! this repository is developed — inherits both. `backend::instance::socket_for`
//! reads the pair: an override tagged for somebody else's data directory is an
//! inherited one and is dropped, and an instance that also relocated
//! `TALOS_DATA_DIR` then lands on a socket *derived* from that directory.
//!
//! That rule is right — a harness that isolated its database but not its server
//! would be spawning windows on the operator's tmux — but it means a harness
//! which pins a socket without clearing the inherited tag spawns its windows on
//! a name it never chose, and the `kill-server` in its teardown kills a name
//! nothing created. One orphan tmux server, with the agent processes inside it,
//! per test run, forever. That is how a developer's machine came to hold a
//! hundred of them.
//!
//! Being *reachable* is only half of it. A harness that pinned a socket
//! correctly and then panicked before its `cleanup()` left the server running
//! and took its socket file away with the tempdir, so nothing could connect to
//! reap it either — 400 of them on one machine, 4 sockets between 433 servers
//! (issue #1175). Reaching teardown was never something a test could promise:
//! a failed assertion, a `.expect()` on a racing tmux and a nextest
//! `slow-timeout` termination all skip it.
//!
//! `tests/cli_socket_isolation.rs` owns the resolution and pins it. What is
//! here is its consequence for a test harness, in four tests: the recipe that
//! avoids the leak driven end to end, a harness panicked on purpose to show
//! the reap survives it, and two gates — one holding
//! `tests/support/tmux_server.rs` to the recipe, one holding every harness in
//! this directory to the guard. Read off the sources rather than by running
//! them, because the leak is silent: a run that leaks still passes every
//! assertion it makes.
