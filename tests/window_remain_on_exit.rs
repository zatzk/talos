//! Every window talos creates carries the `remain-on-exit` its role wants.
//!
//! The option is a **window** option, so `set-option -t <session>` never set it
//! for a session — tmux resolves that target down to the session's current
//! window (measured, tmux 3.2a). Which windows carried it was therefore an
//! accident of when `ensure_ready` last ran, and the two roles want opposite
//! answers:
//!
//! - an agent's window keeps its corpse, so the error it printed stays readable
//!   and the listing can still report `#{pane_dead}`;
//! - a plugin's program is read from its output *stream*, and tmux announces a
//!   pane's death only by closing its window — so a kept window is a death that
//!   is never announced, which is what "the editor hung" was.
//!
//! Asserted on a real tmux through the real spawn paths, because what is being
//! tested is the wiring: a helper returning the right string proves nothing
//! about which windows are told.
//!
//! Skipped when tmux is absent: a missing multiplexer is an environment fact.
