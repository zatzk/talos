//! Tearing a session down must not kill a live session's window.
//!
//! The reaper resolved its victim through `agent_target`, which falls back from
//! a stale pane id to the `tb-<name>` window name unconditionally. That fallback
//! is right for a *live* session — you still want to reach its window after a
//! tmux restart renumbered the panes — but a reap must first know that nobody
//! else answers to the name: once the deleted row's pane no longer resolves, a
//! `tb-<name>` window is its own only while no live session shares the name.
//!
//! The sequence below is the one that bites in practice. A session freezes, the
//! operator deletes the row and recreates it, and 30-60s later the reaper for
//! the *deleted* row closes its undo window and kills the *replacement*. Each
//! delete-and-recreate arms one more of these, so the session dies faster every
//! time.
//!
//! The fix is not reap-shaped, so neither is this suite any more: every window
//! carries the id of the session row that owns it (`@talos_session`, ADR-25),
//! and force delete, stop and restart resolve that stamp exactly as the reap
//! does. The last test here walks all three.
//!
//! Scoped to a throwaway socket and temporary directories, and skipped when
//! tmux is absent, like the other end-to-end tests here.
