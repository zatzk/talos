//! A tmux server a harness cannot forget to reap.
//!
//! Every e2e harness here needs the same three things — a pinned socket name,
//! the inherited owner tag cleared, and a `TMUX_TMPDIR` of its own — and then
//! needs the server killed again afterwards. Spelling the teardown as a
//! `cleanup()` called at each exit point made correctness rest on *counting*:
//! `tests/spawn_command_resolution.rs` had eleven of those calls and
//! `tests/create_e2e.rs` more, and a panic between the first `tmux` call and
//! the last one reached none of them. A nextest timeout reached none of them
//! either. The servers that escaped that way were unreachable rather than
//! merely untidy — the socket file lives in the harness's tempdir, so it went
//! away with the test and left a server nothing could connect to, agent
//! processes and all, until the machine was rebooted (issue #1175).
//!
//! [`TmuxServer`] makes the reap structural instead: hold one for as long as
//! the server should live and its `Drop` kills it, whether the test returned,
//! asserted or panicked.
//!
//! Two things it owns deliberately:
//!
//! - **The socket directory.** It is the guard's own `tempfile::TempDir`, not
//!   the harness's, so the kill cannot race its removal: `Drop::drop` runs to
//!   completion before any field of the struct is dropped, so the server is
//!   already dead by the time the directory goes. A harness that kept
//!   `TMUX_TMPDIR` in a tempdir of its own was one reordered local away from
//!   killing a server whose socket had just been deleted.
//! - **Every socket in that directory**, not just the pinned name. A run that
//!   landed on a name it did not choose — the failure
//!   `tests/tmux_server_leak.rs` exists to catch — started a server too, and
//!   reaping only the pinned name would leak exactly the thing under test.
//!
//! What it cannot cover is `SIGKILL`, which runs no destructor:
//! `scripts/dev/reap-tmux-servers.sh` (`just reap-tmux`) is the sweep for
//! that, and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` says when to run it.
