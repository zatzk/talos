//! A program pane must notice that its program ended.
//!
//! The regression this guards was silent in every direction. tmux control mode
//! announces a pane's death only as `%window-close` / `%unlinked-window-close`
//! — by WINDOW — while output is streamed by PANE, and nothing related the two,
//! so the notification was parsed as `Notification::Other` and dropped. The
//! pane's channel then simply went quiet, which is indistinguishable from a
//! program with nothing to say: `has_exited` stayed false for ever.
//!
//! Everything downstream is built on that flag. `program.exited` never fired,
//! so a pane could not move on from a finished program; the surface kept
//! painting the grid it left behind; and `start_program` — idempotent by
//! design, because plugins ask on every frame — kept answering `Ok(())` to
//! every request to start it again. Quitting the editor with `:q` therefore
//! made its pane unopenable for the rest of the session, with nothing in the
//! log to say why.
//!
//! Driven through a real tmux pane because the thing that was wrong is the
//! protocol reading, not the bookkeeping around it: a test that set the flag
//! itself would have passed all along. Skipped when tmux is absent — a missing
//! multiplexer is an environment fact, not a regression.
//!
//! The session is created with **`remain-on-exit on`**, which is not decoration:
//! it is what talos sets for its own session (`SESSION_OPTS`), so that a dead
//! agent leaves a readable window behind. With that option a window does NOT
//! close when its program ends — the pane simply goes dead and stays — and the
//! close notification never comes. The first version of this test used tmux's
//! default (`off`), passed, and proved nothing about the machine it was written
//! for. A test of this has to stand in the session the program actually runs in.
