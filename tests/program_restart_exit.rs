//! A program that is restarted still reports that it ended.
//!
//! `program.exited` is derived by comparing the program panes held now against
//! the ones held at the previous look: a key whose pane reports `has_exited` and
//! was seen running before is an ending. The loop, though, applies the commands
//! plugins enqueued **before** it derives — and a plugin that asks for its
//! program on every frame (the documented pattern, which is what makes
//! `start_program` idempotent) asks again on the very frame after its program
//! died. `start_program` then replaces the finished slot, and the derivation
//! that runs a few lines later is handed a *live* pane under the same key. No
//! transition, no event: the plugin that restarted the program is never told the
//! old one finished, which is exactly the plugin that most needs to know.
//!
//! So the ending is recorded where the slot is overwritten, and drained where
//! the transition is derived. Asserted through the real restart path on a real
//! pane, because the claim is that the replacement *reaches* the recording —
//! setting the flag by hand would have passed before the fix too.
//!
//! Skipped when tmux is absent: a missing multiplexer is an environment fact.
