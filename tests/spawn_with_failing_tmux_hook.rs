//! A user hook on the tmux server cannot cost talos a window it created —
//! an agent's, or the automation heartbeat keeper's.
//!
//! tmux hands a command-mode client the exit status of the last `run-shell` its
//! command list triggered — hooks included. An `after-new-window` hook left
//! behind by an uninstalled tmux plugin runs a script that is no longer there,
//! `/bin/sh` answers 127, and the *client* exits 127 although `new-window`
//! itself succeeded and printed the pane id. Reading that status as the verdict
//! is what reported `Failed to spawn tmux window: tmux new-window exited exit
//! status: 127` on a server that had just created the window (issue #1154), and
//! the hook's own output — printed on the same stream as the `-P` answer — is
//! what corrupts the id if stdout is taken whole.
//!
//! Asserted against a real tmux, because what is being tested is which of the
//! two answers talos believes.
//!
//! Its own binary and its own socket because the hook it installs is
//! **server-global**: borrowing another suite's socket would leave every spawn
//! in it answering 127 for reasons of its own.
//!
//! Each test gets its own server, not a shared one: `cargo nextest` runs every
//! test in its own process and each `TmuxServer` guard gives it a socket
//! directory of its own, so the socket *name* they share resolves to a
//! different path per test — the same shape as
//! `tests/window_remain_on_exit.rs`. Under plain `cargo test` that does not
//! hold: one process, one `TMUX_TMPDIR`, and these tests will reap each
//! other's server. Run them with nextest, which is what `.publish.yaml`, CI
//! and the pre-commit hook all use.
//!
//! Skipped when tmux is absent: a missing multiplexer is an environment fact.
