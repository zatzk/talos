//! Relaunching every session at once, onto a tmux server that is not there yet.
//!
//! This is the first thing talos does on a machine that has just rebooted:
//! `missing_agents` finds every session unplaced and `respawn_missing_agents`
//! hands each one to its own worker, so N spawns arrive together at a server
//! with no talos session on it. `ensure_session_configured` used to check
//! `session_exists()` and then create — which is not a lock, so every worker
//! saw "no session", every worker ran `new-session`, one won and the rest were
//! told `duplicate session`. A loser's whole respawn aborted: no window, and a
//! row still naming the pane id the *dead* server had given it — an id the new
//! server had by then reissued to whichever session won. That session sat with
//! no agent, and because `respawned` marks a session the moment it dispatches,
//! nothing tried again for the life of the process.
//!
//! Driven against a real tmux server on a private socket, because the race is
//! in tmux's answer and nothing in-process can stand in for it. Skipped where
//! tmux is not installed, like `tests/attach_by_name.rs`.
