//! A local spawn must launch the agent **talos** resolved, not whatever the
//! multiplexer's own `PATH` happens to resolve.
//!
//! talos used to hand tmux a bare command name (`claude`) and let tmux
//! resolve it. Which resolver ran, and with which `PATH`, was not talos's to
//! choose: tmux copies the *client's* `PATH` into the new pane only for an
//! **unattached** client (`spawn.c`: "the session one is replaced from the
//! client ... only unattached clients"). talos's control-mode client is
//! attached, so its windows got the `PATH` of whatever first started the tmux
//! **server** — and a single-token command is handed to that server's
//! `default-shell` rather than `execvp`, so the resolver could be a shell
//! talos never chose.
//!
//! Under zsh/bash the two `PATH`s agree, because the interactive additions live
//! in `~/.zshenv` / `~/.profile`, which any shell that starts a server sources.
//! Under **fish** they do not: `fish_add_path` writes `fish_user_paths`, which
//! only fish applies — so a server started from anything else never sees them,
//! for the life of that server.
//!
//! The same spawn also decides the `PATH` its pane runs on, and the tests below
//! the first one are about that half: a pane resolves `talos-cli` by bare
//! name for every status hook, and how many arguments the window command has
//! decides whether tmux runs it through a shell at all.
//!
//! Skipped when tmux is absent rather than failing: a missing multiplexer is an
//! environment fact, not a regression.
