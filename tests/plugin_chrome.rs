//! What a pane may say, and what it may set off, outside its own rect.
//!
//! Two gaps this closes, both recorded in the panes themselves. The creation
//! flow states one of them in a comment — "a plugin cannot write the message
//! band (it is kernel chrome), so a refusal this flow makes itself is shown on
//! its own footer row instead" — and pays a row of every modal for it. The
//! other is quieter: the kernel's own modals are reachable from a `role =
//! "action:…"` node and therefore only from the *mouse*, so a pane could not
//! open help from a key handler at all.
//!
//! Both are commands rather than globals, for the reason every write is one: a
//! plugin says what it wants and the loop does it on a later frame. The
//! coordinator half — the band actually showing the text, the modal actually
//! opening — is asserted on a real terminal in `tests/tui_e2e.rs`; what is
//! pinned here is the vocabulary, and that a mistake in it is refused rather
//! than swallowed.
