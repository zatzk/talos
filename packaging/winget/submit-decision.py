"""The winget channel's two decisions, out of the workflow so they are testable.

Usage: submit-decision.py decide --throttle-days N [--now ISO8601] [PRS_JSON]
       submit-decision.py after-submit --exit-code N [OUTPUT_FILE]

`decide` reads `gh pr list --json number,state,createdAt,title` output (stdin by
default) and prints `{"should_submit": bool, "reason": str}`. Two things stop a
submission: a talos PR still **open** on winget-pkgs (submitting on top of it
is what accumulates the backlog its moderators complain about — wingetcreate has
no "update the pending PR" mode), and a last submission younger than
`--throttle-days`. At `--throttle-days 0` only the open-PR rule can gate, which
is the Chocolatey-parity cadence: attempt every release, let the moderation
queue itself set the pace.

`after-submit` reads a finished `wingetcreate submit` — its exit code, plus its
output (stdin by default) — and prints `{"opened": bool, "deferrable": bool,
"fail": bool, "reason": str}`. `deferrable` is the winget analog of the
Chocolatey job's 403/409 test: the channel pushed back, so warn, exit green and
retry next release. Everything else is a red job, including the stale-fork
failure the sync step ahead of `submit` exists to prevent.

`opened` is what gates the close-superseded-PRs step, and it is true only when
`submit` actually opened a PR. Gating that cleanup on the *pre-submit* decision
instead is a trap worth naming: a deferred submission exits green having opened
nothing, and cleanup would then close the pending talos PR on winget-pkgs and
put nothing in its place — leaving the channel with no PR at all, so the version
silently never ships. That is the failure this whole job exists to prevent, only
worse, which is why `opened` and `fail` are computed here and tested rather than
inferred in the workflow.
