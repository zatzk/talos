# Talos plugin kernel and plugin authoring

*Working reference indexed by `AGENTS.md`. The rationale behind these decisions is owned by the docs under `docs/`; a change that invalidates what this says updates it in the same PR.*

## Architecture (plugin kernel)

The interface is **Lua running on a Rust kernel**. `talos` boots the kernel,
which reads `ui/` and renders whatever plugins it finds; there is no built-in
pane. v1's `src/app` (TEA model/update/view) and `src/ui` (35 render modules) were
deleted when the kernel took the binary name — v1 lives on the `v1.x` branch.

### The five rules

1. **Four node kinds, forever** — `text`, `box`, `input`, `surface`. Everything
   else composes in `ui/lib/widgets.lua`. `tests/kernel_mvp.rs` asserts the count.
   A new appearance arrives as a **prop** on one of the four: `text` takes a
   `style` the kernel paints across its whole rect before the spans go on top,
   which is what a selection bar or hover band is — no pane pads a row with a
   spacer span, and a span naming its own colour keeps it (a search hit stays
   visible under the bar). `widgets.list` exposes it as `selected_style` /
   `hover_style`. A `frame` takes `title_align`, `border_type`
   (`rounded`/`square`) and an `overlay` — runs painted onto its own border
   cells (`top_left`/`top_right`/`bottom_left`/`bottom_right`/`right_column`)
   after the block, which is where the session list's dot strip and `▲ N`/`▼ N`
   counts and the terminal pane's scrollbar live, at the cost of no content
   cell. And a **run** takes `id`/`role`, so a chip inside a line is a click
   target over its own columns without becoming a node; adjacent runs sharing an
   identity coalesce into one hitbox, which is what makes ` ◀ F9 ` — an accent
   chevron and a muted hint — a single button.
2. **Layout resolves before render** — rects are computed first, then each plugin
   is called with its own. Plugins declare size *statically*, in their declaration
   table, which is what breaks the circularity.
3. **Snapshot-read, command-write** — reads come from an in-memory snapshot and
   return instantly; writes are commands accepted now and surfaced later. Lua never
   blocks, so no plugin can stall the loop on SQLite, git or an unreachable host.
4. **Capabilities by absence** — an ungranted capability is *not in the
   environment*. `io`, `os`, `debug`, `package` and the loaders are withheld, and
   `talos.yml` makes selene enforce that statically. One capability cannot be
   expressed that way: a program pane is asked for through `command`, which every
   plugin has, so `talos.granted` reports the grant instead — a boolean about a
   decision already made, which withholds nothing.
5. **Anything touching the world runs on a worker** — terminal attach, commands,
   diffs, metrics, git stats, repository reads, update checks, and programs a
   plugin asked for.

### Module Dependency Rules (enforced by tests/architecture_rules.rs)

```text
node                 may reference                     [fully-qualified path only]
session              nothing — pure data, the dependency sink
agent                agent::{generic,provider} (re-exports only)
agent::*             every file a node: session, paths, shell and the other
                     agent::* files each declares (NEVER git, NEVER backend)
agent::host_config   session, paths, agent::agent_config
backend              backend::{contract,pane,registry} (re-exports only)
backend::contract    nothing — the trait and the values crossing it
backend::identity    backend::contract
backend::instance    session, paths                    (ADR-12 socket naming)
backend::pane        session, backend::{contract,identity,osc8,output_wake}
backend::osc8        session
backend::output_wake nothing
backend::registry    session, backend::contract        (a container, no factory)
backend::wiring      session, shell,                   (the factory: the only
                     agent::host_config,                node naming an adapter)
                     backend::{contract,registry,
                     tmux,psmux,rmux}
backend::tmux_compat nothing — declares the three below (tmux protocol helper)
  ::control_mode     shell, backend::contract,
                     backend::tmux_compat::transport
  ::server           session, paths, shell,            (the shared server,
                     agent::{host_path,preflight},      generic over the mux)
                     backend::{contract,identity,

                     transport}
  ::transport        shell, agent::preflight
backend::tmux        session, shell, backend::contract, (the tmux adapter)

                     server,transport}
backend::psmux       session, shell, backend::{contract, (the psmux adapter —
                     instance},
                     backend::tmux_compat::{control_mode, a peer, never tmux's)
                     server,transport}
backend::rmux        session, shell, backend::contract, (the RMUX adapter)
                     backend::tmux_compat::{control_mode,
                     server,transport}
git                  session, paths, shell
storage              session, sync, paths
sync                 session
usage                session, shell                    [paths]
session_ops          session, storage, git, sync,      [agent::<the config it reads>,
                     paths, workspace, shell            backend::{contract,identity,
                                                        instance,registry}]
kernel               session, storage, sync, paths,    [agent::<the config it reads>,
                     session_ops, git, notifications,   backend::{contract,identity,

                                                        registry}, kernel]

clipboard            session, paths
workspace            paths
paths                nothing — leaf utility
shell                session (HostLauncher::for_host)
coordinator          agent::{input,settings_config},   (main's body: the loop,
                     backend::{output_wake,
                     wiring}, clipboard, kernel,        the workers, the chrome)
                     paths, session, session_ops,
                     shell, storage
```

Enforcement is an **allowlist**: every module under `src/` needs a `ModuleRules`
entry naming what it may reference in *any* form (`use`, `pub use`, brace groups,
fully-qualified `crate::…` — and `talos::…`, the only spelling the binary's own
modules have for the library), so a new module fails the test until its place is
declared. Only the crate roots (`bin`, `lib`, `main`) are `EXEMPT`;
`coordinator/` has an entry of its own listing the layers it wires, because
"wires everything" was never the same claim as "may reach anything". `kernel` reaches
`agent`, `backend::*` and `usage` by fully-qualified path only — never `use` — so
every crossing into the side-effect layer is visible at its call site, the rule
`session_ops` and `cli` already follow. A function-local `use crate::agent::…` (or
`as` alias) breaks it too. One test, `every_module_rule_holds`, loops over every
entry — a rule used to be able to exist with no test calling it, which is how
`kernel` drifted.

A rule names a **node**: a top-level module, or a submodule governed on its own —
every file module of `backend` and of `agent`, at any depth, is one
(`SUBMODULE_GOVERNED`). A grant covers exactly its node, never the node's children,
and a reference is judged where it **resolves** (`tests/architecture/resolver.rs`):
`super::`, `self::`, nested brace groups, `as`, an imported name, a `pub use`
re-export and a `type` alias are all followed, so no spelling carries a crossing
past a rule. On top of the allowlist: the production graph and the declared graph
must both be acyclic (`the_production_graph_is_acyclic`,
`the_declared_graph_is_acyclic`), every grant must be used by production code
(`every_allowance_is_used`), only `coordinator` may be granted the factory
`backend::wiring` and only the factory an adapter
(`only_the_composition_roots_name_the_factory`), the adapters are peers —
none reaches another and `backend::tmux_compat` reaches none, test code
included (`the_adapters_are_peers`) — and each adapter's code names exactly its
own `Multiplexer` variant (`every_multiplexer_the_factory_serves_has_an_adapter_of_its_own`,
ADR-31), and the crossings still to be
removed are the `TRANSITIONAL` table — each item saying why it is there and
what removes it, checked both ways so a new crossing fails and so does a stale
entry. It is **empty**: lifecycle, pane I/O, platform and finally status and
the heartbeat (ADR-29, ADR-30, ADR-32) go through the contract, and
`consumers_reach_no_concrete_backend` holds `session_ops`, `cli` and `kernel`
to reaching no adapter, protocol helper or factory — by reference, through
aliases and re-exports, or through any grant transitively. `agent` is
submodule-governed like `backend`, so a grant names the agent config a node
reads. Fixture trees under `tests/fixtures/architecture/` pin that the
resolver sees the old three-node backend cycle, PR #1272's mux/registry cycles,
alias and re-export laundering, and test-only edges.

### Module Responsibilities

- **`kernel/`** — the interface. `node` (four primitives), `layout` (rects before
  render), `convert` (Lua table ↔ node), `paint` (node → ratatui), `host` (the VM,
  reload, isolation, capability grants), `registry` (keys + settings plugins
  declare, plus the chord-less commands the palette lists), `events` (the
  closed set a plugin may subscribe to, and the deriver that diffs a snapshot
  into them), `modals/` (help, settings, theme picker, the command palette —
  chrome about talos itself,
  which plugins contribute *data* to rather than replace), `bands` (the top/bottom
  bars), `snapshot` (the read side), `command` (the write side), `terminal/` (live
  PTY surfaces: the attach machinery, plugin program panes, link detection +
  OSC 8 painting — every surface owns its own rect and size memo, and a
  session's agent and its `#shell` companion are two of them, never one),
  `selection` (mouse text selection over a pane),
  `consent` (the one-time v1→v2 gate), plus the worker-backed
  stores: `diff`, `metrics`, `repos`, `runs`, `updates`, `files`, `notify`,
  `theme`, `perf`, `bundled`, `inventory`, `packages` (the spec, the lock, and the
  install/converge/withdraw operations — sharing `bundled`'s decision matrix).
- **`agent/`** — the agent and host config layer. `AgentProvider`
  - `GenericProvider` build the CLI invocation from a declarative `AgentDef`;
  the other files read talos's config (agents, hosts, hooks, settings,
  themes) and run the preflight and self-update.
- **`backend/`** — the session-backend boundary. `contract` is the
  `SessionBackend` trait every consumer names; `registry` holds one backend
  per route and `wiring` is the only factory naming an adapter. `TmuxBackend`
  and `PsmuxBackend` are peer adapters over `tmux_compat::Server<M>`, reached
  through a `TmuxTransport` (an optional `HostLauncher` — ssh or WSL — plus the
  multiplexer binary). `pane::Session` wraps a backend's pane: output is read
  into `Arc<Mutex<vt100::Parser>>`, input written over an mpsc channel.
- **`session/`** — plain data: `SessionId`, `SessionInfo`, `SessionState` and
  the read-time status folds (`hook_status`, the one module the kernel *and*
  the CLI derive a session's state through),
  `SessionConfig`, `AgentDef`/`AgentRegistry`, `HostDef`/`HostRegistry`,
  `PluginSpec`/`PluginLock`/`PackageManifest` (`plugin_spec`, so the kernel and the
  CLI share one definition), plus the logic the kernel needs and cannot import
  `agent` for (`hyperlink`, `review`, `theme_config`).
- **`git/`** — every `git` invocation, split by concern: `command` (the one
  place a `git` process is built, and where the inherited `GIT_*` scrub lives),
  `plugin` (clone/checkout of a plugin working copy), `remote` (running a command
  over ssh/`wsl.exe`, the PowerShell encoding, and decoding what came back —
  ADR-13's psmux divergences), `discovery` (listings, path classification,
  child-repo scans, each a POSIX/PowerShell script pair over one line protocol),
  `diff` (diffs, branches, commits, worktree stats) and `worktree` (create, list,
  sync, remove — and the stale-lock/stash/transient-error retries). `git::*` is still
  one flat surface; no caller names a submodule.
- **`coordinator/`** — `main`'s own body. `App` and its state stay in
  `main.rs`; its behaviour is here, grouped by what it is for: the loop and its
  workers (`mod`), then `commands`, `publish`, `draw`, `input`, `mouse`, `focus`,
  `events` (the one dispatch point, and the kernel events derived from the
  loop's own signals) and `interface` — plus `boot` (the startup sequence `main` delegates to),
  `chrome` (the terminal/error-panel/perf-HUD helpers) and `editor` (the
  `Ctrl+O` command resolution). Still one model and one loop — splitting `App`
  itself is what ADR-22 rejected, and the invariants that matter hold *across*
  these groups.
- **`ui/`** (Lua, not Rust) — `layout.lua` is the arrangement; `lib/` holds
  widgets, theme roles, fuzzy match, text input, trees — plus the extracted
  pane halves: `chrome` (every framed pane's focus styling), `modal`
  (frame + footer), `scroll`,
  `order` and `session_model` (the session list's model, with its memo),
  `pathpicker` and `repo_picker` (the creation flow's); `plugins/` holds the
  panes.
- **`cli/`** — `talos-cli` subcommands, including `plugin dir|new|check|list|events|install|sync|update|remove`
  for writing an interface with no TTY.

### Event Loop (`src/main.rs` + `src/coordinator/`)

```text
tokio::main → load config + settings → heal extensions → arm the heartbeat
  → the v1→v2 consent gate (kernel::consent, before the terminal is taken)
  → resolve ui/ → build the Lua host → open SQLite → init terminal → loop {
    resolve layout → call each plugin with its rect → paint
    → poll workers (terminals, commands, diffs, metrics, repos, runs, updates)
    → dispatch events to the plugins subscribed to them (kernel::events)
    → drain Lua's command queue → dispatch keys through the registry
} → restore terminal
```

- Logging goes to `~/.local/share/talos/talos.log` (stdout is the TUI's)
- A panic hook restores the terminal, pops the kitty flags and disables mouse
  reporting before printing — otherwise the shell inherits a raw-mode terminal
  streaming mouse reports. A **signal** gets the same treatment
  (`coordinator::boot::install_signal_restore`): `SIGHUP`/`SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`
  run `restore_terminal` and exit `128 + n`, since the default action runs no
  hook and a terminal emulator closing, a session manager, or a machine waking
  from a long sleep used to leave the next shell printing `\x1b[<64;…M` on
  every scroll. `restore_terminal` shows the cursor itself for the same
  reason — a signal exits from the runtime's thread and drops no `Terminal`.
  The one case no handler reaches is a **dropped ssh connection** to a remote
  talos: the `?1003l` has no pty to travel down, so the *local* emulator
  keeps reporting — `reset` there, or run the ssh session inside a local tmux.
  `tests/tui_e2e.rs` pins both exits' escapes.


## Writing an interface plugin

The bundled set is deliberately small: `10_sessions`, `20_agent`, `65_search`, plus
five floats that occupy no slot — the creation flow (`70_new_session`), the
confirmation (`60_confirm`), the rename field (`62_rename`, `Ctrl+E`), the
context menu (`64_menu`, opened at the pointer by a right press on a session) and
the restore list (`80_restore`, v1's `Ctrl+U`).

```bash
talos-cli plugin dir            # which directory is live, and which rule chose it
talos-cli plugin new notes      # a starter that already loads
talos-cli plugin check          # load it the way talos does; non-zero on failure
talos-cli plugin list           # the inventory the Interface tab shows
talos-cli plugin install top    # a distributed pane, recorded in plugins.toml
talos-cli plugin sync           # make the directory match the spec
```

Two of v1's surfaces are maintained as **out-of-tree panes**, each its own
repository, installed by clone:
[`talos-code-review`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-code-review) (the diff
reviewer, asks for `run` only for the targets the kernel does not compute) and
[`talos-info-panel`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-info-panel) (v1's info
panel, no capabilities — everything from the snapshot). Neither is bundled or
vendored; both are downstream consumers of the published `talos.*` shape.

Two **example** panes live in `examples/panes/` (`tasks`, `top`) and install by bare
name; `examples/lua/{plugin,composite,events,layout}.lua` are copied by hand. They are
examples to read and copy from, not a catalogue talos maintains for anyone —
`EXAMPLE_PLUGINS` is the list a bare name and a typo suggestion resolve against.
`check` fails on a pane that **loaded but which no arrangement places** — the only
failure with no symptom — and prints the `layout.lua` line to add.

**`ui/lib/ui.lua` is the component layer**, and the first thing a pane should
reach for: `ui.panel` (one focus convention — with focus a thick border and a ` ▸ `
title badge, without it a thin one in `border_unfocused`; `ui/README.md` →
Focus), `ui.list` (variable row heights, a sticky window,
the selection bar as the row's own `style`, overflow either as marker rows or as
`▲ N`/`▼ N` on the frame), `ui.cursor` (the selection as the **item** it is on
rather than the row, re-derived on every build so a reordered list keeps it,
plus the steer/publish protocol, so another pane writing `store.selected` moves
the list and the list's own echo is not mistaken for one), `ui.row` (a span builder that
knows the row's width, so a trailing note is budgeted rather than re-measured),
`ui.empty`, `ui.modal`, `ui.footer` (hints resolved from the key **registry**,
so a rebind moves them), `ui.status`/`ui.dots`, `ui.rule`. `lib/widgets.lua` is
the primitive kit underneath it. `10_sessions` and `80_restore` are the two
worked consumers; `65_search`, `70_new_session` and `20_agent` still spell their
own and are the follow-up.

**Two commands reach outside a pane's own rect.** `command("message", { text,
level })` puts a sentence in the message band — kernel chrome stays kernel-drawn
and a plugin contributes to it, as it contributes a pill or a binding, instead of
spending a row of its own on a message line. `command("action", { text =
"help.open" })` runs a declared action through the very handler a click on an
`action:` node runs, so a **key handler** can open help, settings, themes or the
palette; the issuing plugin is the fallback owner, stamped by the kernel. Both
are applied on the UI thread (the action registry, the modals and the band are
the loop's), and both refuse rather than guess — a message with no `text`, or a
`level` no band badges, is an error at parse time and not a silent no-op.

**Measuring text is the kernel's job** (`host::api::install_text`). The `text`
global gives a plugin `text.width(s)`, `text.truncate(s, cols, opts)` and
`text.pad(s, cols, align)`, all in terminal COLUMNS and all backed by the same
`unicode-width` the painter measures with. Lua cannot compute this: `#` counts
bytes, `utf8.len` counts codepoints, and a CJK glyph is one codepoint over two
columns — so a budget counted either way sheared every row with a double-width
name in it. `ui/lib/widgets.lua` forwards to it (`widgets.len`, `truncate`,
`truncate_hard`, `keep_left`, `keep_right`, `middle_truncate`, `pad`), and
`widgets.chars` is the separate codepoint count a CARET needs, since
`input.cursor` is a character offset.

`ui/lib/talos.d.lua` is the API as lua-language-server types — node props and
their allowed values, `ctx`, the `hit`/`key`/`wheel` payloads, the declaration
table, every published `talos.*` row shape, every `command` verb's options, and
the theme roles. It is declarations only; nothing loads it into the VM (which is
why `selene.toml` excludes it — describing a global means assigning one, and that
is the one thing the sandbox forbids). Keep it in step with `node.rs`/`convert.rs`,
`host/load.rs`, `host/publish.rs`, `command/mod.rs` and `theme.rs`, the same way
`talos.yml` is kept in step with `LuaHost::publish`.

Two shapes do the catching, because lua-language-server does **not** flag an extra
key in a table constructor: every kind and every verb declares the field it cannot
work without (a misspelt one reads as `missing-fields`), and every field drawn from
a fixed set is spelled as that set (a misspelt value is `assign-type-mismatch`).
`tests/fixtures/lua_types/` holds three panes that each make one of those mistakes
and `scripts/ci/check-lua-types.sh` fails when any of them stops being reported —
the counterpart to `--check ui`, which only proves the bundled panes are clean.
`tests/fixtures/lua_std/` + `scripts/ci/check-lua-std.sh` are the same counterpart
to `selene ui examples`: selene checks a dotted path a segment at a time, so a
table declared without its fields rejects `talos.platform.os`, and no bundled
pane reads one by name to notice.

The two files split by LIFETIME. A global, or a field of a published table, is a
name selene can see, and it belongs in `talos.yml` — kept in step with
`LuaHost::publish` *and* `LuaHost::enter`, which sets `talos.runs` and
`talos.granted` per plugin. The shape of a value that exists only while a call
is running — a `hit`, a `key`, a `wheel`, a row out of a list — is unreachable
from there and is `talos.d.lua`'s. Neither file can do the other's half.

The directory ships its own guidance for whoever edits it: `README.md` is the
reference, and **`AGENTS.md`** is the operational half a coding CLI loads as context
without being asked — which is what stops "install this plugin" being read as a
package-manager request rather than `talos-cli plugin install`. `CLAUDE.md` and
`GEMINI.md` beside it are one-line pointers, not copies, so there is one file to
keep true; an extension surfaces its own spec the same way, as symlinks it can
make because it copies its own files.

Two rules pick the directory: `TALOS_UI_DIR` if set, otherwise the user's copy
(`~/.config/talos/ui/`, materialised from the embedded interface on first run,
preserving edits). A third rule — a `./ui` beside the working directory, winning
automatically — was removed: it made the interface the one config that ignored the
dev/release split, so `cargo run` in the repository read `~/.config/talos-dev` for
agents, settings, themes and the database and the *checkout* for its panes, silently.
Editing a checkout's interface is now an explicit `TALOS_UI_DIR` (`just tui-ui`),
and startup reports the directory whenever there is a question about it — an override
is in force, the fallback was used, or this is a dev build. The user-copy path is
derived
from `paths::config_file()` like every other config path — `agents.toml`,
`hosts.toml`, `hooks.toml`, `settings.toml`, `themes.toml`, `extensions/`, `ui.json` — so a **dev
build reads `~/.config/talos-dev/ui`** and cannot touch the release copy.
`TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` overrides that anchor and talos injects it into every
session it spawns, which is why a `talos-cli` run *inside* a session resolves
against that session's config dir rather than the dev default. `config show` prints
the resolved `ui_dir`/`ui_json` beside the rest. The resolved directory is
made **absolute** — trust, the disabled set and rebindings are keyed by
`ui_dir.join(file)` and compared verbatim, so a relative `ui` would be shared by
every checkout on the machine. It is *not* canonicalised: that would return a
`\\?\D:\…` extended-length path on Windows and resolve `/var` to `/private/var` on
macOS, and this path is shown to people.

**Delivery vs. decision vs. composition.** `.bundled.json` records what delivery did
(bundled / edited / yours / removed / installed); `ui.json` records what the *user*
decided (disabled, trust, rebindings); `plugins.toml` records what the interface is
**composed of** and `plugins.lock` what each entry resolved to.
Deleting a bundled file is how you remove it — delivery records
the removal and never writes it back, which is what makes a differently-named
replacement possible on equal terms. Turning one **off** is a third thing: present on
disk, intact, not loaded — implemented by `build` not reading the file, so a disabled
plugin declares no keys, occupies no slot and is granted no capability. A broken one
can be switched off to get a working interface back.

**A plugin that carries more than Lua is a repository** (`ExtensionSource::Git`,
`git::clone_plugin`). The fetch path returns a `String` and decodes remote output
lossily, so a binary through it is *corrupted rather than refused* — which is why
payload arrives only by clone and that path stays Lua-only. Recognition is
**explicit**: `git+<url>`, a `.git` suffix, or `git@host:path`; a bare `https://` URL
keeps meaning "fetch the manifest's files from this base". The working copy lands at
`<ui_dir>/<name>/` and **keeps its `.git`**, so `update` is a fetch and git owns "your
edits are yours" (a dirty tree is never moved and reports `kept`). The lock records
the **commit**, not the ref, which is what makes a spec reproducible and why there is
no checksum field. Two consequences elsewhere: `build` loads panes the spec names
outside `plugins/` (`is_nested_pane`; the load order still comes from the basename's
numeric prefix) and `sources()` inventories those panes but deliberately does **not**
walk the rest of a working copy. `.git` is watcher noise (`watch::is_noise`) — a fix
in its own right, since it already affected anyone versioning their own panes, and the
symptom is not "reloads too often" but "stops reloading while git is busy".
`talos.platform` is published so a plugin shipping several binaries picks one
itself; platform selection is deliberately not a manifest field.

**`talos.preflight` is a read, not a probe.** Whether the multiplexer is
installed, and whether each agent's `command` resolves, is answered by
`agent::preflight` from `SnapshotStore::poll_preflight` — on the kernel's
schedule, behind a 10-second window, and published in the snapshot as
`talos.preflight.mux` and each agent row's `presence`. It is polled from
`refresh_if_due` rather than from `refresh`, because `refresh` stops running
altogether on a database nobody writes to, which is exactly the state talos is
in while the user is off installing what was missing. A plugin that ran the
lookup itself would be running a `PATH` walk per frame, per keystroke or per
row — the regression the window exists to prevent; `kernel::snapshot::tests::
the_preflight_answer_is_cached_rather_than_probed_on_every_tick` pins it.
The local RMUX picker choice uses this same lookup window: `read_mux` omits
RMUX when its binary is absent. Remote choices stay registered because the
remote binary cannot be checked from this machine.
`presence` is three-valued (`present`/`missing`/`unknown`) because a remote
host's binaries, and a relative `command`'s (resolved from the session's own
directory), were never looked at, and `unknown` is not `missing` (see
`docs/CONFIG.md`).

**Panes are installable** (`kernel::packages`, `session::plugin_spec`). `plugins.toml`
in the interface directory lists a `src` (a bare name resolving to `examples/panes/<name>`
at the binary's release tag, a URL, or a path — `extension_config::resolve_source_in`,
one resolver for both kinds of thing), a destination `file`, and an optional `pin`;
`plugins.lock` records what each resolved to plus the digest of every file delivered.
`plugin sync` converges the directory to the spec, which reduces an agent's job to
*edit one file, run one command, read the exit status*. Delivery semantics are
**shared with the bundled path, not reimplemented**: both call `bundled::decide`, so an
edit is preserved and a deletion is remembered for a package exactly as for a shipped
file. Two consequences worth knowing: the manager never writes `layout.lua` (placement
stays hand-authored, and `check` fails loudly on an unplaced slot instead), and a
package may deliver shared modules only under `lib/<its own name>/` — enforced at
install time, since `require` splits on every dot and would otherwise let a package
replace `lib/theme.lua`.

**Trust for an installed pane is keyed to `(src, pin)` *and* the lock's digest**
(`registry::Granted::Managed`, `inventory::Trust::resolve_installed`). Contents alone
would report every ordinary release as tampering; `(src, pin)` alone would let an
upstream re-tag of the same version inherit a grant made to what that version used to
be. Both are checked, and `ui.json`'s bare-string grant form is still read so an
upgrade forgets nothing.

**A plugin can run a program you interact with** (`Capability::Program`,
`kernel::terminal`'s `programs` map). `run` captures output once with no stdin and
no tty, so it cannot give you `htop`, `lazygit` or a REPL; a *program pane* holds a
real terminal — keystrokes go to it, it is resized to its rect, it survives an
`F10` reload. The pane belongs to the **plugin**, not a session: the plugin writes
`command("program", { text = "watch", repo = "htop" })` and draws
`{ type = "surface", program = "watch" }`, and the kernel stamps the owner from the
plugin being rendered, so naming another plugin's pane is impossible by
construction. Reuses the companion-shell machinery whole (`ProgramPane` mirrors
`ShellPane` over the same `Session::wire_up`); the differences are a third window
prefix (`tbp-`; `discover` lists it, but it is stamped `@talos_role=program`
with no session id, so it can never resolve as a session's agent — ADR-25), and
that **nothing is persisted**: the window name is deterministic, so re-adoption
after a restart is a lookup (`find_program_window`) and there is no stored id to go stale. Gated by its own
capability, **not** `run`'s — `run` is bounded (256 KB, 600 s, 4 at a time) and an
interactive program is none of those, so an existing grant must not silently widen.
Four panes per plugin. `talos.granted.<name>` is how a pane knows, since
`command` is present whether or not it may.

**A plugin can run a program** (`kernel::runs`) — `git status`, `docker compose ps` —
in the session's working directory, and on that session's own host for a remote
session. `run(key, program, opts)`; the answer arrives next frame as
`talos.runs[key]`, so Lua still never blocks, and asking **every frame is the
intended pattern** because a fresh answer is a map lookup rather than a process
(`request` refuses a duplicate while the answer is fresh *or* while a run for that
key is in flight). Bounds are the kernel's: output capped with truncation flagged, a
timeout, four at a time with the rest queued.

This is the first capability that reaches outside talos, so it is granted **per
plugin**: declare `capabilities = { "run" }` and get nothing until the user trusts
the file (settings → Interface → `t`). Trust is keyed by absolute path with the
digest recorded, so a changed trusted file reads `trusted · modified`. It is
deliberately **not a sandbox** — a program talos spawns has the user's authority —
and the position is that talos can only refuse to run things unasked.
`examples/lua/composite.lua` is the worked example.

The implementation lives per-call: `LuaHost::enter` stamps the current plugin and, in
the same breath, binds `run` to the implementation or to nil, and `enter_nothing` is
the other half for Lua that belongs to no plugin (`layout.lua` declares no
capabilities). The implementation itself is held in the VM's **registry**, never its
globals, because a plugin chunk's `_ENV` *is* the globals table — it sat there as
`__run_impl` once, which handed every untrusted plugin the capability under a second
name.

**A plugin can react to events** (`kernel::events`, `coordinator::events`).
Declare `events = { "session.status", … }` and an `on_event(name, payload)`, and
the loop calls it once per change, off the render path, under the render's
budget. The kernel's events are **derived by diffing the snapshot** — a row
appearing, leaving, changing status/name/branch/repos/parent — plus the focus
ring, the command bus (`command.done`/`failed`, and `session.post_*` for the
four operations *this* interface performed, named as `hooks.toml` names them) and
`interface.reloaded`; never raised from `session_ops`, so a session another
process made fires the same event. The set is closed (`KERNEL_EVENTS`): a
subscription to an unknown name refuses to load, and the same table renders in
`F1` and `talos-cli plugin events`. `command("emit", { text = name, … })`
delivers `user.<name>` to other plugins with `source` stamped by the kernel;
cascades stop at `MAX_DEPTH`. Dispatch never marks the frame dirty itself
(`frame-cost`); a reload drops the queue and delivers `interface.reloaded` first.
`examples/lua/events.lua` is the worked example.

**A plugin can declare chord-less commands** — `commands = { { action, desc } }`
— which the **command palette** (`Ctrl+P`, `kernel::modals::palette`) lists
beside every declared key and the kernel's own actions, filtered by subsequence
as you type; `Enter` runs the row through the same `on_action` a key takes,
focused or not, after the modal has closed. A command a user rebinds from `F1`
becomes a binding (`Registry::apply_overrides` synthesises it). `Ctrl+P` was
taken deliberately from the chords held for v1's panes (`tests/keymap.rs`),
and the creation flow's folder import moved to `Alt+P` for it.

`on_action(action, args)` accepts a read-only table of typed arguments for
instance-scoped UI control. Existing one-argument handlers still work. The
first external actions are `session.focus {session_id}` and
`search.open {query}`; the coordinator validates them and applies them on the
event loop. The local transport lives in `ui_control`, outside the session
backend, and `talos-cli ui` selects the target interface explicitly when
more than one is reachable.
