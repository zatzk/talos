# talos-cli, automations, tasks and messages

*Working reference indexed by `AGENTS.md`. The rationale behind these decisions is owned by the docs under `docs/`; a change that invalidates what this says updates it in the same PR.*

## talos-cli

A second binary (`talos-cli`) drives the same SQLite-backed,
tmux-hosted sessions headlessly (no TUI). It shares the database
with the TUI; changes appear via `PRAGMA data_version` polling.

```bash
cargo build --bin talos-cli
talos-cli session create --name demo --repo-path /path \
    --agent codex --worktree-branch feat/x
# Spawn on a remote host from hosts.toml (worktree + tmux live remotely):
talos-cli session create --name demo --repo-path /srv/repo \
    --host devbox --worktree-branch feat/x
# Spawn a worker under a lead session (parent must exist):
talos-cli session create --name worker --repo-path /path \
    --parent <lead-uuid>
# Multi-repo: each --add-repo gets its own worktree on --worktree-branch;
# --add-dir attaches a repo as-is (no branch). The agent launches in a
# symlink workspace gathering every repo. Works on `task create` too.
talos-cli session create --name demo --repo-path /a \
    --agent claude --worktree-branch feat/x \
    --add-repo /b@main --add-repo /c@master --add-dir /reference
talos-cli session list                       # human-readable table
talos-cli session list --json | jq           # machine output for scripts
talos-cli session list --parent <lead-uuid> --json | jq  # direct children only
```

Subcommands: `ui` (instances/state/actions/action/input for a live local TUI),
`schema` (CLI command tree plus that instance's live UI action catalog),
`agent` (launch-args — see below), `session` (create/list [`--deleted`]/get/delete/reap/restore/restart
[`--if-missing`]/rename/stop/start/fork/exec/meta/reports-as/send [`--no-enter`]/key/capture/focus/signal/doctor/sync/register —
`sync`/`register` and the flags serve session sharing, ADR-24), `watch` (stream
the session event log, one event per line), `runtime` (status/stop — what
talos runs that is not a session), `automation` (alias `auto`:
create/list/show/edit/remove/run/runs/tick), `task` (alias `todo`:
create/list/show/edit/remove/run), `message` (alias `msg`:
send/inbox/prune — the inter-session mailbox queue; see below), `editor`
(get/set the Ctrl+O editor command; `editor mode <auto|terminal|gui>` chooses
how it launches — terminal editors get a real TTY via a tmux popup or TUI
suspend, GUI editors spawn detached; see the Editor Integration section of
`docs/FEATURES.md`), `config`
(validate/show — strict-parses every config file / prints the
effective resolved config; see `docs/CONFIG.md`), `extension`
(alias `ext`: install/uninstall/reinstall/list/available/update/activate/
deactivate/status — manage opt-in extensions; see below), `version`
(prints the running version; `--check` queries GitHub's latest release —
gated on `[features] version_check`, on by default for 1.0), `update`
(downloads, verifies, and replaces the installed binaries with the latest
release **within the current major** — a new major is reported, never installed,
because 2.x replaced the whole interface; `--force` bypasses the
up-to-date/dev-build/major guards; gated on
`[features] auto_update`, on by default for 1.0; the TUI also runs this silently on
startup when the flag is on), `notify`
(diagnose OS desktop notifications: prints the detected delivery backend
and last error; `--test` fires a sample — see OS notifications below), `perf`
(print the perf snapshot a running TUI publishes while `TALOS_PERF_LOG`
or its perf HUD is active; `--plugins` for one row per pane, sorted by cost,
with hints — see `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`), `plugin`
(interface plugins without a TTY: `dir` reports the directory in force and
which of the two rules chose it, `new <name>` writes a starter that already
loads, `check` loads the interface the way `talos` does and exits non-zero on
a failure — **including on a pane that loaded but which no arrangement places**,
printing the `layout.lua` line to add — `list` is the same inventory the settings
modal's Interface tab shows, and
`events` lists every event a plugin may subscribe to with its payload, and
`install|sync|update|remove|available` manage panes from a declarative spec
— see `docs/PLUGINS.md`), `doctor`
(whether **this machine** has what a session needs: the multiplexer and its
version, every registered agent's `command`, the launcher for each configured
host, and the full search path. The companion to `session doctor`, which asks
whether an *existing* session's status hooks are wired — this one names no
session, so it answers on a machine where nothing has been created yet. `fail`
and a non-zero exit only for what must work: no multiplexer, or no registered
agent that resolves anywhere; a partly-installed registry is `warn` and exits 0.
See "What is missing, before you hit it" below).

### What is missing, before you hit it

talos starts with **no** multiplexer and no agent installed, deliberately.
`agent::preflight` is the one answer to "is the thing that would run this
actually there?", and it is asked in four places: the create-session flow (an
agent that resolves nowhere is marked on its row; a missing multiplexer is
stated from the flow's first step), the empty session list, the spawn error, and
`talos-cli doctor`.

Three rules it is written under, each of which a change here must keep:

- **It never blocks.** A `Missing` answer is a warning on the choice, not a
  refusal — a `command` may be a shell function, an alias, or something
  installed a second later. Same rule as `tmux::resolve_local_program`:
  resolution is an improvement where it succeeds, never a new way to fail.
  `session create` reports it as a `warnings` entry beside `hook_failures`, and
  still creates the session.
- **It is never on a hot path.** The probe is a `stat` per absolute `PATH` entry
  per binary (no process spawn), run from `SnapshotStore::poll_preflight` on the
  kernel's schedule behind a 10-second window, and published in the snapshot.
  A plugin *reads* `talos.preflight.mux` and each agent row's `presence`; it
  never probes. `kernel::snapshot::tests::the_preflight_answer_is_cached_…`
  pins that.
- **It never invents an install command.** Windows is pointed at psmux, never at
  tmux; where the command depends on a distribution the package name is given
  with a link to the project's own install page. A missing *agent* is answered
  with the `agents.toml` entry that decides what runs, because talos bakes in
  no knowledge of any agent's installer.

`Presence` is three-valued on purpose: `unknown` is not `missing`. A remote
host's binaries live on the host, and a relative `command` (e.g. `./bin/agent`)
is resolved from the session's own directory rather than talos's — in both
cases nothing was looked at, and reporting either as `missing` is the
conflation the module exists to end (see `docs/CONFIG.md` for the full rule).

A failure to *launch* the multiplexer goes through
`preflight::launch_failure`, which turns only a `NotFound` into that sentence
and leaves every other io error alone — a permission error is not something an
install fixes.

### A session reference is a name, a UUID, or an id prefix

Every session verb takes the same reference, resolved in that order: a full
UUID first (unambiguous by construction), then an exact name, then a unique id
prefix. **Ambiguity is refused, never guessed** — names are not unique (talos
does not enforce it, and a mirrored host contributes rows that legitimately
collide), so a reference matching two sessions exits **3** and names both ids —
its own code, because a driver reconciles "no such session" (exit 1) by creating
one and can only escalate "several answer to that name". `--parent` and
`session restore` resolve the same way; restore resolves against the *deleted*
rows, since that is where its subject now is.

`session create --on-existing <allow|adopt|replace|fail>` answers "a session of
this name already exists" — one question, four answers, because none of them is
safe to assume:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `allow` (default) | create another one; both are then addressable only by id |
| `adopt` | return the existing session with `created: false` — idempotent, what a driver reconciling desired state wants |
| `replace` | tear the old one down (`delete --force`) first |
| `fail` | refuse, naming the id in the way; exit 1 |

**The match is scoped to the server the creation lands on** — this machine's
multiplexer, or its `--host`'s — whichever spelling each row's `backend_type`
carries (`session_ops::server_key`: a legacy `ssh:devbox` row and a new
`ssh:devbox:tmux` one are one server). The name namespace is not: a mirrored
host's rows sit in the same table, so an unscoped match let a local `replace`
force-delete a session on another machine, `fail` refuse a local create because
of a remote namesake, and `adopt` return an id whose pane is elsewhere.

`adopt` answers with `stopped` and `state` as well, because the reason to adopt
is to skip the follow-up read — and what it hands back may be a **parked**
session, which refuses `send`/`key`/`capture`. `create` publishes the same two
(`false`/`unreported`) so the shapes stay identical.

`allow` is the default because talos **cannot** enforce uniqueness: a database
mirroring a shareable host (ADR-24) holds that host's rows beside its own, and
two machines may each legitimately have a session called `build`. Uniqueness is
something a caller asks for per creation, not a property of the namespace — which
is why `fail` exists at all, and why both firstmate and a Gas City provider were
each hand-rolling it with their own list-then-create race.

`adopt` and `replace` refuse an *ambiguous* name (one matching several
sessions) with exit 3, for the same reason the reference resolver does: adopting
one of two, or destroying one of two, is a guess. Every mode is decided before
anything is spawned, so a refusal leaves no window, worktree or row behind.

`replace` is the one mode that acts before the spawn, and it cannot be reordered
— the replacement wants the branch and the checkout the old session holds. So a
spawn that fails after the teardown **rolls back**: the session it replaced is
restored best-effort (row, branch, agent), and the error says so. Uncommitted
work went with the force delete and does not come back. It is a check,
not a lock — two simultaneous creates can still both pass, which is inherent to
a spawn that must make a multiplexer window before it has a row.

### Any command can be a session

`--agent` names an `agents.toml` entry; `--command` **is** the definition:

```bash
# A shell — the ready-made form, and a built-in agent
talos-cli session create --name probe --repo-path . --agent shell

# Anything at all, with its own environment
talos-cli session create --name build --repo-path . \
    --command npm --arg run --arg watch --env NODE_ENV=development
```

A `--command` session persists its **launch recipe** (command, args) on its row,
because there is no registry entry to re-resolve; `session restart` replays it
verbatim. A registry agent deliberately stores no recipe, so it is resolved by
name at every launch and editing `agents.toml` then restarting still takes
effect. `--env` is the exception both kinds store: it is the *caller's*, not
the registry's, so a registry agent's row carries it too — replayed on restart
and reproduced by `session exec`.

What a command session does **not** have is a conversation. `resume_args` and
`fork_args` are what address one, and only an agent definition declares them —
so `--resume` is refused for a raw command (the error names the fix: give it an
`[[agents]]` entry), and `session fork` gives you a second session in the same
directory rather than a continued one. Talos never learns what a conversation
*is*; it only knows how to address one.

### Parking a session: `stop` / `start`

`session stop` kills the pane and keeps everything else — the row, the checkout,
the branch, the agent's own history on disk. It is the verb between "leave it
running" and "delete it": reclaiming a heavy agent's pane used to mean deleting
the session, which also removed its worktrees.

A stopped session is marked, not merely pane-less, because three things repair a
session that has no pane on sight — the interface's respawn of surveyed rows, a
peer's `restart --if-missing` after a reboot, and extension self-heal. All three
skip a stopped row; `session start` is the only caller that clears the mark.

Those same three also skip a row that is **already being restarted**. A restart
kills the window and then spawns its replacement, and in between the session is
pane-less for the same reason a parked one is, so a repairer used to put a
second agent on it and the ADR-25 stamp landed on two windows (issue #1207).
`restart` holds the row for the length of the operation —
`Database::claim_session_restart`, the name claim re-keyed on the session id —
and a repairer stands down while somebody holds it. `restart` and `start`
themselves do not: a hold outlives its holder by minutes by design, and one left
behind by a restart killed mid-flight must not refuse the verb the operator
typed. What keeps two of those to one window is `backend::tmux`, which retires
every window but the highest-numbered one carrying a session's stamp each time a
stamp is written, and again before it gives up on an ambiguous one.

The mark is **reported by the read verbs**, not only by `watch`: a parked
session stays in `session list` and carries `stopped: true` with
`state: "stopped"` on `get` and `list` — the same key and type the stream uses.
`state` is `stopped` rather than the agent's latched last word or one of the two
silences, because all three describe a session that is running. `backend_id`
keeps naming the window it had (that is what the row records; `session start`
replaces it), and `send`/`key`/`capture` refuse a parked session by name instead
of reaching for the window that is gone.

### `session exec` — run something in a session's context

```bash
talos-cli session exec worker -- git status --porcelain
```

A separate process in the session's directory, on the machine the session lives
on, **under the session's own environment** — its recorded `--env` plus the
`TALOS_*` identity its pane carries, with the *caller's* `TALOS_*` scrubbed
so a driver running inside one session cannot lend the child that session's
identity (a `session signal` through `exec` used to record for the caller, with
exit 0). The environment used is in the result's `env`. Deliberately **not**
typed into the pane, which belongs to the agent and would interleave with
whatever it is doing. The command's exit code is always in the output;
`--exit-passthrough` additionally makes it this invocation's own — a command
exiting 2 is *that command's* 2, not a usage error, which is the distinction
Gas City's `proc.exec` capability is defined by. `exit_code` is `null` when the
command was terminated by a signal rather than exiting; passthrough then takes
the generic failure code, since there is no code to carry.

Arguments to `--command` may start with a dash (`--arg -c`): passing a switch is
the usual reason to pass an argument at all.

### `agent launch-args` — the hook wiring, for a driver that launches its own agent

```bash
talos-cli agent launch-args claude                      # command + args + env
talos-cli agent launch-args claude --session <ref>      # …resolved for one session
```

Status hooks are **arguments**: the `hooks` extension installs them by appending
to an agent's `args` in `agents.toml` (`--settings <hooks>.json` for claude), so
they reach the process only when talos builds the command line. A driver that
launches the agent itself — `session create --command`, or typing into a shell
session — therefore got no hooks, so `state` never populated and `watch` reports
no state transition for that session. This prints what talos would run; pass the args
through and the hooks are there.

`--session <ref>` resolves it for one session: the conversation id is pinned to
that row's, the host adapts the args (a remote session's hook configs are
shipped there), and the env carries the `TALOS_SESSION` the agent's
`session signal` will report under. Without it the env names only this instance
(config dir, data dir, socket). Always a **fresh** launch — continuing a
conversation is `session start`/`restart`.

### `session meta` — the driver's key/value space

`set`/`get`/`list`/`unset`, namespaced by convention (`fm.*`, `gc.*`), never
interpreted by talos. Without it a driver's identity ends up encoded in the
session *name*, which then has to be parsed and kept unique and inside the
64-character limit. `set` reads the value from stdin when it is not an
argument.

`get` answers with the **bare value** in every format but JSON — being
captured into a shell variable is what makes stdout a pipe, so the piped
default would otherwise hand back the record in exactly the case the command
exists for. An unset key produces nothing; `--json` returns the record, and is
the only form that tells a `null` value from a key that was never set.

### `talos-cli watch` — nothing has to poll

```bash
talos-cli watch --json --initial | while read -r line; do …; done
```

One event per line as sessions appear, change state, or go —
`{"seq":41,"event":"changed","reason":"state","session":"…","name":"…",
"from_state":"working","to_state":"blocked","state":"blocked",…}`. It works
with no interface running, because everything worth waking on is already in the
database.

**It streams a log, not a diff.** Every writer that changes what a watcher
reports appends a row to `session_events` (schema v43) in the same transaction
as the change — `set_hook_state`, the park/un-park mark, the delete and restore
verbs, the spawn upsert, both pane-option polls and the mirror pass. `watch`
tails that table by `seq`, still waking on the `PRAGMA data_version` gate the
sync worker uses, so it costs a pragma per tick rather than a query. The
previous implementation sampled every session every 250 ms and diffed the
samples, which collapsed any two transitions inside one sample: `working →
blocked → working` around an auto-answered permission arrived as *nothing at
all*, and the driver never learned the permission had been asked. A log written
by the writer cannot lose a transition.

Each line carries:

| field | what it says |
|---|---|
| `seq` | monotonic, never reused — what `--since` resumes from |
| `event` | `present` (baseline) / `created` / `changed` / `gone` |
| `reason` | `spawned`, `registered`, `restored` · `state`, `stopped`, `started`, `updated` · `soft_deleted`, `force_deleted`, `forgotten` |
| `from_state`, `to_state` | the transition itself, for a `changed`/`state` event |
| `state`, `hook_state`, `state_source`, `hook_coverage`, `hook_blocked_is_heuristic`, `hook_state_contradicted`, `detected_agent` | the same gating fields `session get` publishes, so reacting to a `blocked` needs no follow-up call |

`reason` is what a bare event name could not say: a `gone` used to mean both
deletes, and only one of them is restorable. `hook_state_contradicted` is
`null` — *not checked* — unless you pass `--verify`, which costs a multiplexer
query and a `ps` per event, the same trade `session list --verify` makes.

`state` is the same `SessionState` word every other surface answers with, and
it is derived from the event's **own** `to_state` so two transitions inside one
wake-up stay two events. The `done → idle` acknowledgment is the exception and
deliberately reads the row's current `seen_at`: "somebody has looked at this
since" is a fact about now, so a replayed `done` an operator has already read
reports `idle`, matching what `session get` says for that row in that second.
`to_state` still carries the event's own word verbatim, so the transition
itself is never lost.

`--session` narrows it to one (the log is filtered, not the output),
`--for-secs` bounds it, `--initial` emits the current state as `present` rows
first, and `--since <seq>` resumes from the last event a driver handled — the
gap a stream otherwise has across a restart. The stream exits as soon as its
reader closes the pipe rather than sitting out its `--for-secs`.

**One vocabulary.** `state` on `get`, `list`, `watch`, the bare `talos-cli`
home view and the interface's own session list are all `SessionState`
(`src/session/hook_status.rs`), derived by the same read-time folds, so a
driver reconciling two surfaces never reconciles two vocabularies. The folds a
surface can apply are the ones whose inputs it can observe: everyone reads the
stored columns (including `seen_at`, so an acknowledged turn is `idle`
headlessly too), while terminal quiescence and host reachability need a live
interface and are never guessed. The one remaining difference between `get` and
`list` is the pane probe — see `session list --help`.

**A parked session takes no hook state at all.** `session stop` killed the
pane, so a heartbeat's pane-option poll or a mirror pass carrying a host's last
word would otherwise write a turn onto a session with no process to be in one —
and every watcher would see a transition that did not happen. `session signal`
against a parked session fails, saying to `session start` it first.

The format follows the CLI-wide rule: human in a terminal, TOON down a pipe
(one `events{…}:` header, then a row per event — a stream has no length for the
header to declare), `--json` for one JSON object per line. `--pretty` is
`--json` here: a stream's frame is the line.

### Remote sessions are driven, not refused

`send`, `key`, `capture` and `exec` work on a `--host` session: they delegate to
that host's own `talos-cli` (the mechanism the mirror pass already uses).
A refusal survives only where delegation is genuinely impossible — no
`hosts.toml` entry, or no reachable CLI there — and says which.

### `runtime` — what talos runs that is not a session

The automation heartbeat is kept by this machine's backend — the registry's
default (`SessionBackend::ensure_heartbeat`; on a tmux-protocol server a
detached `automation-heartbeat` window) — and created implicitly by anything
that arms an automation. It is not a session, so no session listing shows it
and no delete reclaims it. `runtime status` reports it (`null` when the backend
did not answer), the socket in force, the backend, and `hook_status` — whether
each local backend has a hook status channel; `runtime stop` stops it (the next
`automation` write arms it again).

### talos-cli is an AXI

`talos-cli` is shaped for the agent that runs it, not the person who
occasionally does — it follows **AXI** (`axi/1.0-2026-07`, <https://axi.md>),
the agent-ergonomics spec, and `axi-axi validate` scores it 10 pass / 0 fail.
The shape that follows from that:

- **Output is human-readable in a terminal and TOON down a pipe.** It used to
  be JSON down a pipe. TOON (`src/cli/toon.rs`, a conforming v4.1 encoder —
  <https://github.com/toon-format/spec>) declares each list's length and field
  names once instead of repeating every key on every row, which is about 40%
  fewer tokens on the same answer and 80% on `session list`, where the record
  is wide and the useful part is narrow. Force a format with `--json`
  (compact), `--pretty` (indented), `--toon`, or `--text`.
- **`--json` is unchanged** — every field, exactly the bytes it always
  produced. It is the format scripts parse, so a script must pass it
  explicitly. A pipeline that relied on the *auto* JSON has to spell the flag
  out.
- **A bare `talos-cli` prints live state**, not a usage dump: every session
  with the `state` its hooks last reported — the same word and the same key
  `session list` publishes — the calling session's unread mail,
  and the counts that would otherwise take three more invocations
  (`src/cli/home.rs`). Exit 0.
- **List views default to three or four fields**, the ones that let an agent
  decide what to look at next; `--fields <list>|all` asks for others and
  `--json` gives the whole record. Free text is capped in the TOON view only,
  with the total and `--full` named in place — never in `--json`, which is
  what `session capture … --json | jq -r .output` needs.
- **A zero-result answer says so and names what it searched**, rather than
  printing `[]` — which an agent cannot tell apart from a command that failed
  quietly.
- **Errors are structured on stdout, never stderr**, and the exit code says
  which kind: `0` success, `1` the command ran and failed, `2` the invocation
  was wrong, `3` a session reference matched more than one session. The
  implication runs **one way only**: an `error` key ⇒ a non-zero exit, *never*
  the converse — `session doctor` on a broken session and `config validate` on
  a bad file each exit 1 with a valid, error-free report on stdout, so a driver
  that gates on `$?` before parsing throws away every diagnosis it asks for.
  Read the document; use the code to classify, not to decide whether to parse.
  The trap that follows is worth naming to integrators:
  `talos-cli … --json | jq -r .field` exits **0 with empty output** on a
  failure, because `jq` parsed the error object and the pipeline carries `jq`'s
  status (`pipefail` does not help — `jq` succeeded). Capture, branch on the
  status, then parse. Each carries a `suggestion` and a runnable `help[]` line. stdout
  carries **exactly one** document, so a command that renders its report and
  *then* asks for a non-zero exit (`session doctor` on a broken session,
  `config validate` on an invalid file) comes back as `cli::Outcome::Failed`:
  the report is the answer, the exit code is the verdict, and the sentence
  explaining it goes to stderr rather than becoming a second document `jq`
  cannot parse.
- Results can carry a `help[N]:` block of next steps. It is the one part of
  the output that is AXI convention rather than strict TOON (bare indented
  lines rather than the hyphen-space list items §9.4 asks for);
  `output::render_toon` says why.

The renderer is `src/cli/output.rs` — `CommandOutput` carries the JSON, the
human string, and an `AgentView` (label, fields, help, empty-state, text cap)
that the TOON rendering reads. A command that declares no `AgentView` still
renders as TOON; declaring one is worth it on the commands agents run in a
loop. `tests/toon_conformance.rs` pins the encoder against the reference
implementation on the spec's own 179-case suite.

**Typing into a session: `send` and `key`.** `session send <uuid> <text>` types
text and presses Enter; **`--no-enter`** types it and stops, leaving it
unsubmitted in the agent's composer — an integration that verifies what it typed
before submitting cannot use the submitting form, because that fires every steer
the instant it is typed. **`session key <uuid> <name>`** is the other half: one
named special key (`enter`, `escape`, `tab`, `backspace`, `space`, the arrows,
`home`/`end`, `page-up`/`page-down`, `delete`, or `ctrl-<letter>`), spelled
case-insensitively with either separator (`ctrl-c` = `ctrl+c` = `C-c`) and
resolved through the closed set in `backend::Key` (each adapter spells it in its
own grammar, reported as `tmux_key`). The table is
closed on purpose: tmux does **not** validate a key name — an unrecognized one
is typed into the pane as literal text — so `session key` refuses what it does
not know rather than injecting `Escpe` into somebody's prompt. Text goes out
bracketed-paste-wrapped either way (`paste_prompt_args`), which is what makes it
literal: no shell sees it, a leading `-` cannot read as a `send-keys` flag, and a
newline cannot submit the line before it. Locally the verbs go through the
backend the row's route names (ADR-30); on an `ssh:`/`wsl:` backend
`send`/`key`/`capture` are delegated to that host's own `talos-cli`
(`delegate_to_host` in `src/cli/sessions.rs`), which records their effects in
the host's own database. The refusal survives only where delegation is
genuinely impossible: a backend with no `hosts.toml` entry, or one whose
`talos-cli` could not be reached.

### A pane can run an agent talos did not launch

`session create --command <exe>` makes a session *anything*, and the row is
named after the command's file stem. A driver that opens a shell and then starts
`claude` in it (the `agent launch-args claude` shape) used to leave talos
reading hook coverage against `bash`: `hook_coverage: "none"`, no reportable
states, and — worst of all — `hook_blocked_is_heuristic: false`, asserting the
block signal is structured when it is claude's text match on a notification
body.

When the pane probe has already named the agent, that name is now what coverage
resolves against: `hook_coverage: "presumed"`, `hook_coverage_source:
"detection"`, and the reportable states and heuristic flag of the agent actually
in the pane. `presumed` is a fourth word rather than `full`, and the distinction
is the point — coverage says what wiring *can* report, and seeing claude in a
pane is evidence about the process, never about whether anything wired its
hooks. It is also the one coverage answer that is a **live** reading, so it
comes and goes with the probe (`--no-verify` leaves it `none`) and a declaration
always outranks it.

`session create --reports-as <agent>` and `session reports-as <ref> <agent>`
(`--clear` to take it back) are how the driver says what is in there. The
declaration is stored on the row (`sessions.reports_as`, schema v44), survives
restart, and changes **only** what coverage is read against: `session restart`
still replays the recorded command. It is refused for an agent talos ships no
hooks for, since the whole point is the coverage it unlocks and a typo would
unlock nothing silently. `get`/`list`/`doctor` publish it as `reports_as` (null
when the row reports as itself).

**`detected_agent` is the third name and a different fact.** `get`/`doctor`
(and `list --verify`) also publish which registered agent was found *in the
pane*, under its registry name — `antigravity`, not the `agy` its argv spells —
whenever that is not the agent the row was created with **and the observation
determines which profile it is**. An executable that several registered
profiles share (the shipped `agents.toml` builds exactly that when it shows you
how to pin a model) publishes `detected_agent: null` beside
`hook_corroboration: "foreign-agent"` and `state: "running"`: an agent is
demonstrably there, and `ps` cannot say which profile. `agent` is what the
row was created as, `reports_as` what a driver declared, `detected_agent` what
is observably running; null on an unprobed listing means **not checked**, the
same as every other pane field. It is deliberately never written back as
`reports_as`: a declaration is durable and an observation is not.

The match is in **command position only** — argv0, a shell's `-c` operand or
its script, and past `exec`/`env`/`VAR=value` prefixes. It used to match a bare
token anywhere in the command line, so a driver's multi-kilobyte prose brief in
argv could name an agent that was not there (`perl -e 'sleep 300' claude` read
as claude). A missed identity is a blank; a wrong one is on screen.

`session doctor` follows the same fact from the other end: a `--command` session
that has declared nothing is **`ok`, "no hooks expected"** rather than `fail` —
there is no wiring here to be broken, and failing it made bare `session doctor`
(which diagnoses every active session) fail the whole machine over the exact
session shape talos advertises for drivers.

`session delete <uuid>` **soft-deletes** by default — only the DB row is marked
deleted, and `session restore` revives it. The windows are torn down once the
undo window closes (`UNDO_WINDOW`, 10s) by the one sweep,
`session_ops::reap_overdue_soft_deletes` — driven by the TUI's loop on a slow
cadence (`REAP_INTERVAL`, as background housekeeping the bus keeps no in-flight
record of, so it never captions the message band) and by the heartbeat's tick,
or on demand with
`session reap <ref>` — which is how a peer collects a row on a host that has no
interface of its own (ADR-24), and resolves against the *deleted* rows the way
`session restore` does. Only the **windows** (agent and companion shell, both
found by their `@talos_session` stamp) — worktrees are what makes the undo
lossless and are never touched by a soft delete. `--force`
(`session_ops::delete_session_headless`) also kills the tmux window, removes
the worktrees **talos created** + the symlink workspace, disables `send`
automations targeting the session, and clears its `session meta` key/value space
(the row is unrestorable, so the meta would otherwise outlive it) — for headless
cleanup with no TUI running. Teardown is best-effort
(failures land in the JSON report), but a *remote* teardown that never reached
its host is also written onto the row (`remote_teardown_owed`, schema v46's
`teardown_owed`, shown by `session list --deleted`) and finished by
`session_ops::retry_owed_remote_teardowns` on the next tick or `Command::Reap`
once that host answers — the same two drivers as the reap, and the reason
force-deleting against a machine that is down is allowed to keep working. The
row is always marked deleted last, in one write — a force delete stamps
`deleted_at` and `force_deleted` together rather than soft-deleting first, so a
watcher of `session_events` never sees an intermediate state that reads as
restorable. A worktree the session merely
**opened** (`created_by_talos = 0`, schema v42) is
left on disk and listed in the report's `kept_worktrees`: `git worktree remove
--force` would take the uncommitted work in it too, which is talos's to discard
only for a directory it made.

A `--force` delete stamps `sessions.force_deleted` (schema v37): the row still
appears in the restore list **tagged `force-deleted`** and is restorable
**best-effort** — force-delete removes the worktree *directory* but not the git
branch, so restore reattaches each surviving branch's committed work
(`App::recreate_worktrees`); only uncommitted/untracked changes are gone. Because
that recovery is lossy, the headless `session restore` **refuses a force-deleted
row unless `--best-effort`** (its JSON then carries `best_effort: true`) — but
only when the teardown could actually have lost something. A session whose
worktrees were every one of them opened is restored without the flag, since
nothing was removed. A row with *no* worktrees stays refused: that is every row
predating the column, and the conservative reading is the one that cannot lose
work by being wrong.

`session_ops::restore::restore_refusal` is the single decision behind that, and
it answers two questions, not one: *could the teardown have destroyed anything*
(the lossy case above) and *can this restore deliver what it promises*. The
second refuses — force-deleted or not — a session holding a **borrowed worktree
that is no longer on disk**, naming the path rather than talking about
uncommitted work that was never touched: `restore_session` reinstates the stored
`cwd` untouched and `respawn` anchors on it, so the pane would open at a
directory that is not there. That second question is asked only of a **local**
session: a remote one's checkout lives on its host, so stat'ing the path here
answers about the wrong filesystem, and the host's own `session restore` — which
`restore_session_headless` delegates to — asks it again where the path actually
is. `--best-effort` says yes to either. The command line calls the same function
and only appends the `--best-effort` sentence, so it and the TUI cannot disagree
about what is restorable.

Restore still skips a worktree it cannot bring back — branch gone for one
talos cut, directory gone for one it borrowed — rather than failing outright;
that skip keeps `worktrees_recovered` honest and nothing more, since its result
is never written back to the row.
`restore_session` clears both `deleted_at` and `force_deleted`.

The **TUI** `Ctrl+D` soft-deletes too (with a `Ctrl+Z` undo window). The
`[features] soft_delete` flag (default `true`) governs only this TUI path: set it
`false` and `Ctrl+D` becomes a hard delete — the same
`delete_session_headless(.., force=true)` teardown — since there is no `Ctrl+Z`
for it. That hard delete is **conditional**: a confirmation appears **only when
the session has work at risk** — uncommitted/untracked files, unpushed commits, a
multi-worktree session whose other checkouts the snapshot does not stat, or a
state that can't be read at all (remote host / git error → confirm to be safe) —
itemizing what would be lost; a known-clean session is deleted with no prompt.
"Unpushed" is `ahead > 0` **and** `git.merged ~= true`: a branch the forge
rewrote on merge stays permanently ahead of the default branch (its commits are
ancestors of nothing), so `git::merged_into_default` asks four questions of
`origin/HEAD` (→ `origin/main`/`origin/master`) in ascending cost, first `true`
winning — `merge-base --is-ancestor` (merge commit, fast-forward), `diff
--quiet` against the default (an identical tree, whichever route the content
took), `git cherry <default> HEAD <base>` with every line `-` (rebase-and-merge,
GitLab semi-linear merge), and `git cherry` against the branch squared off onto
its merge base by `commit-tree` (squash) — written with a pinned identity and a
zero date (`git::diff::PROBE_IDENT`), so that probe is a pure function of
`(tree, parent)` and re-asking rewrites the one object instead of leaving a
dangling commit per ask. Local refs only, so it is
forge-agnostic; `nil` means unknown and keeps the question.
The answer is cached against the **commit** it was computed for (`branch.oid`,
already free from the same `status --porcelain=v2 --branch` run), never against
the session: `merged` is a fact about HEAD, and a session that keeps working
after its PR landed is unmerged again on its next commit, so a per-session key
would latch the stale `true` and stop warning about work. Both answers are
cached and they age differently. A `true` stands as long as HEAD does. A
`false` is retired by `snapshot`'s `MERGE_RECHECK` (60 s), because a branch
lands upstream without the worktree moving — but that is a floor on the
recheck's cadence rather than a deadline: the recheck rides on a poll, so the
age it really bounds is 60 s *or* that session's own interval, whichever is
longer, which is six minutes at `git_poll_secs = 30`. Caching the `false` at
all is ADR-P25 — recomputing it is seven subprocesses, per session, per poll —
and it is the safe direction: a stale `false` costs one needless question, a
stale `true` hides commits.
The assessment is the pane's (`at_risk` in `ui/plugins/10_sessions.lua`, reading
the snapshot's `git` stats — v1 computed it in Rust over `git::worktree_stats`),
and the question travels through the shared `store.confirm` to the confirmation
float (`ui/plugins/60_confirm.lua`) rather than a bespoke modal. `Ctrl+U` lists the deleted rows (`ui/plugins/80_restore.lua`,
a float) and `Enter` restores the one under the cursor; a row the kernel **would
refuse** asks first — through the shared `store.confirm` question, not a bespoke
modal — and only then issues `restore` with `best_effort`. What it asks about is
the snapshot's `restore_refusal` (`DeletedRow`, published per row and nil when
the restore would simply run), i.e. `restore_refusal`'s own sentence, not the
`force-deleted` tag beside it: the two differ in both directions, and the pane
must not describe a refusal it does not decide. The tag still says how the row
was deleted, and drives the muted styling. The flag never changes
`talos-cli session delete`, which stays soft unless `--force`.

### Session lifecycle hooks (`hooks.toml`)

The user's own commands, run **by talos** before and after it creates,
deletes, restarts or restores a session — eight events, `session.{pre,post}_
{create,delete,restart,restore}`, declared as `[[hooks]] { event, command,
timeout_secs }` in `~/.config/talos/hooks.toml` (seeded commented-out; read
at fire time, no cache, no restart). **Not** the `hooks` extension: that
installs status hooks *into* the agent CLIs (`<config>/hooks/`,
`session_ops::builtin_hooks`) — the code says `lifecycle_hooks`/`HookEvent`
for this one so the two never blur.

They fire once per operation for every caller because every caller already
ends in the same four pipelines: `session_ops::spawn_session_headless`
(the TUI's create *and* fork, the CLI, `spawn` automations, extension
self-heal), `delete_session_headless` (`Ctrl+D` soft and hard, the CLI,
extension uninstall), `restart_session_headless`, `restore_session_headless`
(the TUI's undo and — since this change — the CLI's `session restore`, which
used to clear the flag alone). `fire_pre` runs before the pipeline's first
side effect and a failure (non-zero exit, timeout, cannot start) is its
`Err`; `fire_post` runs after its last and returns the failures, carried as
`hook_failures` on `SpawnResult`/`ForceDeleteReport`/`RestartReport`/
`RestoreReport` and in the CLI JSON. `SpawnPhase::Hooks` is reported while
the pre-create hooks run, so the placeholder row says so.

- **Data**: `session::hook_def` — `HookEvent` (closed enum, serde-spelled
  as the dotted names), `LifecycleHook`, `HooksFile`, and `HookContext` with
  `env()` (the `TALOS_*` set — unset, never empty, for an unknown fact),
  `json()` (the stdin document) and `workdir()`.
- **File**: `agent::hooks_config` mirrors `host_config` — seed, strict
  parse through `parse_toml_reporting_unknown`, empty-with-warning on
  failure; `hooks_for(event)` in file order. `config validate`/`show` cover
  it.
- **Runner**: `session_ops::lifecycle_hooks::run_hook` — `platform_shell`
  (shared with `Exec` automations), `ctx.env()` + `talos_env_overrides()`
  (shared with `inject_talos_env`, so a `talos-cli` inside hits the same
  DB and the same tmux socket), JSON on a piped stdin, both output pipes drained on threads, a
  `try_wait` poll against the timeout, `kill()` at the deadline. Synchronous
  by design — it runs on whichever thread runs the operation (a worker in
  the TUI, rule 5), and `session_ops` has no runtime to lean on.
- **Cwd rule**: the primary repository when it is a local directory, else
  talos's own — the one path that exists at `pre_create` (no worktree yet)
  and at `post_delete` (worktree gone). A remote session's hook runs
  locally with `TALOS_HOST` set.
- Proof: `tests/create_e2e.rs` (the pairs fire once each with the facts, a
  hook's `talos-cli` finds the row, a veto leaves nothing behind and
  surfaces through the command bus, a post failure leaves the session
  running); unit tests beside each module. User docs: `docs/CONFIG.md` →
  hooks.toml.

### Parent sessions (lead/worker)

Sessions carry an optional **`parent_session_id`** so orchestration scripts can
model lead → worker relationships. `session create --parent <uuid>` sets it (the
parent must be an existing active session — validated before any side effects);
`session list`/`get` emit it in the JSON (`null` for top-level) and `session list
--parent <uuid>` filters to direct children. The link is **purely
informational**: deleting a parent never cascades (orphans render as top-level),
and the parent is only validated at creation. In the TUI, **`Ctrl+F` fork**
records the source session as the fork's parent; the session list nests children
under their parent **within the same repo group** (muted `└` tree prefix; a child
whose parent renders in another group keeps its own position with a `↳` mark).
The nesting lives in `ui/lib/session_model.lua` (`session_model.build`, which
walks the snapshot's rows into depths — a port of v1's `compute_session_order` —
memoized on the published table's identity for the pane in
`ui/plugins/10_sessions.lua`), so
`Ctrl+J`/`Ctrl+K` navigation follows the tree automatically. A `Parent:` row is
the out-of-tree
[`talos-info-panel`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-info-panel) plugin's,
not the bundled interface's. Storage: nullable `sessions.parent_session_id`
(schema v30; v29 is reserved by an in-flight branch).

### Manual session ordering

The session list is **manually orderable**: `Shift+J`/`Shift+K` (session list
focused; rebindable `SessionListMoveDown`/`SessionListMoveUp`) move the selected
session one row down/up. Manual order **wins** — status changes only recolor the
dot, never move a row. A move swaps two adjacent *blocks* (a row plus its nested
children, so a parent drags its subtree): root rows swap within their repo group,
the **whole group** swaps past a group edge, and nested children move among their
siblings only. It is computed over the items the pane actually rendered
(`ui/lib/order.lua`'s `move_block`, `root_ranges` and `child_ranges` — ports of
v1's `move_in_order`), and the result is handed back whole as one
`Command::Order { list }`: the kernel densely renumbers all sessions `0..n` and
persists, so the order survives restarts and syncs across instances via
`data_version` polling. Storage: nullable `sessions.display_order` (schema v31);
`None` = never moved, renders after ordered sessions in creation order (new
sessions append to their group). **`Shift+S`** (rebindable
`SessionListSortAlphabetically`) sorts by name **within each repo group** in one
shot, preserving group order (still by lowest `display_order`) and parent/child
nesting, and issues the same `Order` command (v1's
`sort_alphabetically_within_groups`). A **creation in flight** is a row with no
session behind it yet, so it has no name to sort by: `sorted_within_groups`
holds it out of the comparison and returns it at its group's end, where the pane
draws it and where its session will land. Reading a name off it is what took the
pane down the moment a group held both a session and a placeholder (#1200).

When the list spans **more than one machine** — the live sessions, or a creation
in flight naming a host — and the pane's `group_by_host` setting is on (the
default), the host is the outer grouping axis: this machine's groups first, then each remote host's by name, and
a group header names both (`buildbox · webapp`). The tally is the other half of
the gate and is not a preference — one machine renders exactly what it rendered
before the axis existed however the switch is set, and a creation
counts towards it so the first session on a host names its machine while
it is still being made. A group edge is therefore a host+repo edge, and a `Shift+J` that would
carry a group onto another machine is refused: the swap would be persisted and
then undone by the next build re-clustering the group under its own host. With
`group_by_host` off there are no host edges at all, the way `group_by_repo` off
leaves no repo edges.
`talos-cli session list` grows nothing for this — it already carries
`backend_type` per row, and grouping is a view decision that would only cost the
scripts piping it through `jq`.

All of that is the **grouped** shape. With the pane's `group_by_repo` setting
off there are no group edges to swap past: `ui/lib/session_model.lua` builds one
flat group ordered by `display_order` alone, so `Shift+J`/`Shift+K` move a row
one place anywhere in the list and `Shift+S` sorts the whole of it. Off has to
mean ungrouped rather than merely unlabelled — suppressing the header line while
keeping the clustering made every cross-repo move persist and then be undone by
the next build's re-clustering, with the headers that would have explained it
turned off. Parent/child nesting is unaffected: it is not a repo property.

### Inter-session messages (mailbox queue)

A general, agent-neutral **message queue** lets one session hand another a
**structured payload** without scraping its rendered terminal — the channel
extensions use for agent↔agent coordination (an orchestration lead collecting its
workers' questions, plans and results is the shape it was built for). A message
is addressed **to** a session and carries a
free-form `kind` tag (`questions`/`plan`/`result`/… are conventions, not an enum),
a `body`, and optional provenance. Storage is the `session_messages` table (schema
**v32**, CRUD in `storage/messages.rs`); `Database::claim_messages` is a single
`UPDATE … RETURNING`, so the TUI and a cron tick can drain concurrently
without double-processing.

- **Delivery is native, never keystrokes.** `send`/`reply` hand the body to the
  recipient agent's own inbox (`cli/delivery.rs`): a Claude Code inbox socket,
  or `codex queue --thread <talos.codex_conversation_id>`. Anything else stays
  mailbox-only. A Claude socket is used only when **proven** the recipient's
  (`owned_sockets`): its `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` entry is
  `kind: interactive` and that pid's own environment holds
  `TALOS_SESSION=<recipient>` and `TMUX_PANE=<its backend_id>` (the shell
  pane shares the identity, not the pane) — never by the registry's pane id or
  an inherited `$CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET` alone. `session signal` records a proven hook
  socket (`talos.claude_messaging_socket`) and its registry dir
  (`talos.claude_registry_dir`, searched too when the sender's
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` differs). The send holds a 60 s token-owned lease
  (`delivering_at`, `delivery_lease`) that `claim` skips and that is renewed
  before each attempt; success marks the row read + `delivered_via` (schema
  v48), failure releases it, and a killed sender's lease just lapses.
  Output: `delivered_via` = `claude-socket` | `codex-queue` | `mailbox`, plus
  `delivery_note`. `tests/architecture_rules.rs` keeps the multiplexer (`backend`, `agent`)
  unreachable from this path.

- **Identity (the registry key, self-knowable).** A session's `SessionId` is
  **stable for life** — `respawn_stale_session` reuses the original id on
  re-adoption (no soft-delete + new-row churn), so a cached id or queued message
  never goes stale. At spawn talos injects `TALOS_SESSION` (= the `SessionId`,
  threaded via `SessionConfig.session_id` so it's known *before* launch and reused
  on respawn) and, for task-spawned sessions, `TALOS_TASK` (= the task id) —
  both distinct from the older `TALOS_SESSION_ID` (= `agent_session_id`, read by
  the metrics statusline). So a `talos-cli` call *inside* a session proves its
  own identity without scraping panes or names.
- **Consequence for the CLI surface**: an agent passes **no ids**. `message send
  --to <uuid|name>` stamps provenance from the injected identity, `message reply
  <message_id>` routes back to that message's sender (the replier never learns a
  peer's session id), and `message inbox [--claim]` defaults `--for` to the
  calling session.

**Full flag list, the body/kind limits, backpressure cap, and retention/pruning
are in the Inter-Session Messages section of `docs/FEATURES.md`.**

An automation's `AutomationAction` is one of: **Send** (paste a prompt into a
running session), **Spawn** (start a fresh session and prompt it), or **Exec**
(run a shell command headlessly — `sh -c`, or `cmd /C` on Windows — with no
agent/session; its exit status + tail-truncated output land in the run history).
`Exec` is the deterministic-scheduled-job action (the task-integration sync
extensions use it). The runner is `session_ops::run_exec_command`, which blocks
until the child exits and is called from exactly one place —
`cli::automations`'s `tick`. Firing is **CLI-only**: the interface neither
runs schedules nor holds a worker for them, so there is no in-flight/`skipped`
bookkeeping in the binary that draws the screen. The command is stored in the
`action_command` column (schema **v36**, on both `tasks` and `automations`).
Author one headlessly with `talos-cli automation create --command "<shell>"`
(mutually exclusive with `--session`/`--repo`), or from an extension manifest
(`[[automations]]` with a `command` field instead of `session_ref`/`prompt`).
`Task.action` shares the enum but tasks never carry an `Exec`
(it's automation-only).

Automations fire even when the TUI is closed: the heartbeat the
local backend keeps (`session_ops::arm_heartbeat`, armed on TUI
startup and on `automation create`; on tmux the `automation-heartbeat`
window) loops `automation tick` every 60 s and keeps the server alive. `packaging/` ships opt-in systemd/launchd
units for reboot-proof firing. Concurrent firers are de-duplicated
by `Database::claim_due_automation` (atomic CAS), so the keeper,
an OS timer and a hand-run `tick` never double-fire.

**No automations pane.** The interface has none, and `[features] automations`
no longer hides one: its only *effect* in the TUI is gating **arming the
heartbeat** at startup (`src/main.rs`; it also rides the live-reload merge
as a restart-only flag and is published to Lua in `talos.features`). The rows
are published as `talos.automations` and the kernel accepts an `automation`
command (enable/disable/run/delete — `run_now` only marks it due, so the tick
stays the one execution path), so a pane is a plugin somebody can write: both
halves are done and nothing in `ui/` uses them yet.

## Tasks (todo list)

Todo items (title + markdown description + status), **CLI-only**: the interface has
no tasks pane. The data, the storage and the agent linkage are unchanged, so
extensions and scripts that used them still work.

A task can be **acted on by a coding agent**: `Task::agent_prompt()` builds an
`id + # title + markdown description` block plus self-service hints (`talos-cli
task show <id>` to read the record, `talos-cli task edit <id> --status done` to
close it), and `task run` sends or spawns. Triggering advances `Todo → InProgress`.

- **Data** (`session/task.rs`): `Task` (`id`, `title`, `description:
  Option<String>`, `status: TaskStatus` {`Todo`/`InProgress`/`Done`}, `action:
  Option<AutomationAction>`, plus `source`/`external_id`/`external_url` for
  tracker sync — `source = "local"` for native todos, a tracker tag for imported
  ones. `(source, external_id)` is the dedup key.
- **Storage** (`storage/tasks.rs`, schema v25/v26): `tasks` mirroring the automation
  action columns plus a nullable `description`, soft-delete via `deleted_at`,
  audited under `EntityType::Task`, `idx_tasks_external` on `(source,
  external_id)` (v35) backing the upsert lookup.
- **CLI**: `talos-cli task` (alias `todo`) —
  `create`/`list`/`show`/`edit`/`remove`/`run`, with `--description` (markdown) and
  the external-sync flags. `[features] tasks` is **accepted and ignored** — nothing
  reads it, in the CLI or anywhere else.
