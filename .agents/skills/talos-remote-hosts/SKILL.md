# Talos remote SSH and WSL hosts

*Working reference indexed by `AGENTS.md`. The rationale behind these decisions is owned by the docs under `docs/`; a change that invalidates what this says updates it in the same PR.*

## Remote SSH & WSL Sessions

Sessions can run on an **off-local host** while the TUI runs locally: a
**remote machine over SSH**, or a **local WSL distro** (`wsl.exe`). A WSL
distro is modeled as "SSH without the ssh" — the *only* difference is the
launch prefix (`wsl.exe -d <distro>` vs `ssh <dest>`); tmux, git, the agent,
and the worktrees all run **inside the distro** at native Linux paths, so
everything downstream of the launcher (control-mode protocol, POSIX quoting,
worktree layout) is identical to the SSH path — no `wslpath` translation. Hosts
are declared as data in `~/.config/talos/hosts.toml` (seeded commented-out;
fresh install = zero SSH hosts, behaves as before), **plus WSL distros are
auto-discovered** (`wsl.exe -l -q`) with no config — on Windows and, via
interop, from inside a distro as well. What discovery never offers is the
distro talos is running in: a **loopback** (`HostDef::is_wsl_loopback`, keyed
on `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`) is this machine, so sessions on it are local. It is
dropped from both halves of the registry — discovered and configured (the
configured one with a warning). A configured host that reaches a sibling but is
*named* after the current distro (`shadows_current_wsl_distro`) registers as
`wsl:<us>` and is therefore indistinguishable from a loopback row. It is kept
**exactly as written** — it works — and what it costs instead is the repair, for
that one name: the rows under it are the bug's local rows *and* the host's own
sibling rows at once, so both rewrites are wrong for half of them and neither is
attempted (a notice says so, counted with `rows_recorded_on` and skipped when
the claimed spelling holds no row). That is one case of a general rule — the
repair never rewrites a spelling a host it still serves registers under,
including a dropped loopback's own free-label `name`, which auto-discovery may
hand straight to a real sibling. Rows a released build already
relabelled `wsl:<us>` (being shareable by default, the loopback was mirrored,
and its "host" database was this database, so the pass rewrote our own local
rows as remote) are put back by a one-time repair rather than by the migration:
schema v47 only marks it **owed**, and `session_ops::repair_wsl_loopback_rows`
runs it from every startup that opens the database — the TUI boot *and* the
`talos-cli` entrypoint. Siblings stay ordinary hosts. The seeded file
documents every field inline; the schema:

```toml
# An SSH host (the default kind):
[[hosts]]
name = "devbox"               # required — backend id "ssh:devbox"; what --host expects
destination = "me@devbox"     # required for ssh — target ("user@host" or ~/.ssh/config alias)
ssh_opts = ["-o", "ControlMaster=auto", "-o", "ControlPersist=10m", "-o", "ServerAliveInterval=15"]
                              # optional (default []) — extra ssh flags; no ~ expansion, use abs paths
socket = "talos"            # optional (default "talos") — host `tmux -L` socket
session = "talos"           # optional (default "talos") — host tmux session name
worktrees_dir = "/home/me/.local/share/talos/worktrees"
                              # optional — abs worktrees dir on the host
multiplexer = "tmux"          # optional (default "tmux") — set "psmux" for a Windows SSH host
platform = "windows"          # optional — "posix"/"windows"; unset = windows iff multiplexer is psmux

# A WSL distro (only needed to OVERRIDE auto-discovery, e.g. a custom worktrees_dir):
[[hosts]]
name = "ubuntu"               # → backend "wsl:ubuntu"; what --host expects
kind = "wsl"                  # required to select the WSL transport
distro = "Ubuntu-22.04"       # optional (default = name) — the wsl.exe distro name
```

Only `name` (+ `destination` for ssh, `kind` for wsl) is required; every other
field's default is in the comments above and in `docs/CONFIG.md`.

How it works: each tmux-protocol adapter — `TmuxBackend`, `PsmuxBackend`, and `RmuxBackend`,
all `tmux_compat::Server<M>` — runs over a transport-neutral
`backend::tmux_compat::transport::TmuxTransport` (an optional
`shell::HostLauncher` plus the multiplexer binary — the launcher never adds
`-L`). The local backend launches `<mux> -L talos …`; an SSH backend launches
`ssh <dest> <mux> -L <host socket> …` (the host's socket, ADR-12); a **WSL
backend launches `wsl.exe -d <distro> <mux> -L <host socket> …`**
(`HostLauncher::Wsl`). Every remote command builds its
launcher with the one conversion `HostLauncher::for_host`. `wsl.exe` forwards whitespace-free tokens to the
in-distro shell like `ssh` does, so the same POSIX quoting
(`shell::posix_quote`) and the byte-identical control-mode protocol
(`control_mode.rs`) apply — only the one-time process launch differs. (An arg
*containing whitespace* is preserved as one word, so multi-word `sh -c` scripts
go through `wsl.exe --exec` instead — see `shell::wsl_command` /
`git::host_shell_c`.) Every `wsl.exe` is started **off the interface's
terminal** (`shell::wsl_exe`: `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows, `setsid` on Unix):
a `wsl.exe` child reads its parent console's keyboard input even with all three
stdio handles redirected, so the control-mode connection of an attached WSL
session used to take every key — the interface kept painting and answered
nothing (measured: 0 of 8 keys reached a console reader beside `wsl.exe … sleep`,
8 of 8 with the flag; pinned by `tui_e2e`'s
`the_keyboard_is_still_the_interfaces_while_a_wsl_session_is_attached`). The local default multiplexer
(`Multiplexer::default_for`) is **`tmux` on Linux/macOS and `psmux` on
Windows**, but all three adapters are registered on every machine and host
(ADR-31) — psmux is a native-Windows, drop-in tmux clone (ConPTY, no WSL)
speaking the **same control-mode wire protocol** and pane-id (`%N`) / `-L`
socket model, so the shared server (`backend::tmux_compat::server::Server<M>`)
is generic over the multiplexer and `backend::tmux` / `backend::psmux` / `backend::rmux` are
peer adapters answering `TmuxCompatible` (a remote SSH host can also pin
`multiplexer = "psmux"`); a WSL distro runs its selected multiplexer inside the distro (tmux by default).
RMUX >= 0.10.0 is opt-in, tested locally on Linux; real SSH, WSL, macOS and
native Windows integration remain unverified. Installation, selection, version
evidence and protocol limits live in `docs/CONFIG.md` → *Multiplexer requirements
and RMUX setup*. The
tmux control-mode protocol is identical over SSH and WSL, with
**psmux divergences** (verified against psmux 3.3.6, each a body in the psmux
adapter, never a branch on the binary's name; spawning needs psmux ≥ 3.3.7,
asked of the server by `check_psmux_version` — ADR-13 has why) — older psmux lacks `send-keys -H`, and psmux does not join
`new-window` trailing tokens or honour its `-e`, implements no control-mode
paste command, and has **no per-window options**. So talos re-encodes
keystrokes from the primitives psmux does support (`psmux_send_keys_commands`),
using one named key for each arrow or navigation sequence, folds
env + command into **one token** of PowerShell (`psmux_window_powershell`),
routes a bracketed paste out of band through the one-shot CLI
`psmux send-paste` (`psmux::PsmuxPaste`), and neither writes nor reads
the ADR-25 window stamp there (`stamp_window` / `create_window` /
`stamps_are_per_window`) — `set-option -w` writes a *server-global* option that
`#{@...}` then answers with for **every** window, which made one session's id
every window's identity. psmux also **answers the argv `attach-session` with
no `%begin`/`%end` block**, so `ControlMode::start` drains one only where one
is sent (`ControlPolicy::implicit_attach_reply`); draining psmux parks `ensure_ready`
on a read that never returns, which is why discovery reported nothing and no
pane ever attached on Windows (issue #1168 — the two faults are independent and
either alone is the whole symptom). Each
workaround has non-obvious quoting/tokenizing constraints — **read the psmux
divergences subsection of ADR-13 in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before touching this
path**; delivery is probed by `scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh test` (probes C, D).
On psmux 3.3.8, cold `new-session -d` sometimes refuses or returns before a
server answers. Its `has-session` deletes a starting server's port file after
a failed TCP connection, so the adapter probes with `list-windows`. The
adapter omits `-x/-y` for the initial placeholder, allowing psmux to claim a
warm server, and retries transient `no server running` replies from setup and
window creation with a bounded final wait. tmux keeps its size flags and one
attempt. Psmux's global `set-option -g` commands include `-t <session>` so
they do not route to `__default`. The failure occurs
with psmux alone and is independent of v2.42.0's control-mode changes.

A host's **platform** is its own field (`HostDef::platform`, `session::Platform`,
ADR-13 "The host's platform is its own dimension"): `platform = "windows"`
declares a native Windows host on any multiplexer, and an entry that sets none
keeps the old reading (`multiplexer = "psmux"` ⇒ Windows, else POSIX; a WSL
distro is always POSIX). `default_shell`, the `default-command` pin and the
`/bin/sh -lc` login wrap follow the platform, never `cfg(windows)` or the
multiplexer's name; `needs_liveness_poll` follows whether its control stream
closes pane readers on window deletion (tmux yes, psmux and RMUX no). Tests simulate the Windows build
with `session::platform::simulate_local`. A Windows host has no POSIX shell. So
each remote probe ships **two scripts emitting one line protocol** —
`git::host_probe` picks `sh -c` or `powershell -EncodedCommand`
(`host_powershell_c`; UTF-16LE base64, because ssh space-joins its args for a
default sshd shell that is commonly PowerShell and expands `$…` inside them) —
and `git::remote_home` resolves `%USERPROFILE%` rather than `$HOME`, which under
`cmd`/PowerShell prints the literal string and exits 0. Remote error *messages*
are cleaned in one place (`git::reportable_stderr`): OpenSSH ≥ 10's three-line
post-quantum advisory is dropped (it is informational, on stderr, and **first**,
so it used to be the whole reported error), and PowerShell's `#< CLIXML` stderr
envelope is decoded to the message inside it. See the two subsections after
"psmux divergences" in ADR-13.

Each host registers one backend per adapter, named by its route
(`ssh:<name>:<mux>` / `wsl:<name>:<mux>`, `backend::wiring`'s table, built from a
`BackendSpec` of route, launcher, platform and host), registered lazily from
`host_config::load_all_with_warnings`: discovery/down hosts must
not block startup, so `check_available`/`ensure_ready` are deferred to first use
— looking a backend up is a map read, and the blocking `ensure_ready` runs on the
attach worker in `kernel::terminal` (and on the spawn worker for a fresh
session), never on the loop, ADR-P12).

- **Data**: `session::HostDef` (with `kind: HostKind {Ssh, Wsl}`) /
  `HostRegistry` (pure data, in `session/` so both `agent` and `git` can use
  it). A row's `backend_type` is read by one parser, `session::Route`
  (machine × optional multiplexer; grammar and legacy meaning in
  `docs/CONFIG.md` → *Multiplexer choice and existing sessions*), and
  resolved by one resolver, `HostRegistry::host_of` / `qualify`: the host
  comes back as configured, never with a platform read off the route.
  `session_ops::windows::backend_for` finds the backend a row's route names in
  the injected registry, refusing a route none serves (ADR-29);
  `session_ops::server_key`
  compares two rows' servers whatever spelling each carries. A host name may
  not contain `:` (refused at load). **Loading**: `agent::host_config::load_all{,_with_warnings}`
  = configured hosts + `discover_wsl_hosts()` (deduped; a configured entry
  wins), with every entry claiming the current distro settled first
  (`settle_wsl_self_hosts` / `wsl_hosts_from`): a loopback dropped, a
  backend-name shadow kept as written. `augment_with` is the pure dedup both
  the load path and the repair path go through, so they cannot disagree about
  which host ends up serving a name.
- **The one-time repair**: `session_ops::repair_wsl_loopback_rows`, guarded by
  the `wsl_loopback_repair_owed` mark schema v47 writes and it clears. Run from
  **both** startups that open the database (`coordinator::boot` and
  `bin/talos-cli`), because the mark is written by whichever gets there first.
  What it rewrites is a `session::WslRepairPlan` decided by the registry as
  callers *see* it — `agent::host_config::wsl_repair_plan` settles then
  augments with discovery, the loader's own two steps in order:
  - Candidates = `wsl:$WSL_DISTRO_NAME` **plus** each dropped loopback's own
    `backend_name()` (a hand-written `name = "self", distro = "<us>"` wrote
    `wsl:self`, and dropping the entry without healing those rows strands
    them).
  - `to_local` = the candidates no served host registers under; `withheld` =
    the rest, matched on the whole backend name (an `ssh:` host named after a
    distro serves none of its rows, so it withholds nothing).
  - Only a question that could not be **asked** keeps the owed mark, and only
    where the answer depended on it: an unparseable `hosts.toml` and distros
    that could not be enumerated are both `Err`, so nothing is touched and a
    later start retries — but `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME` is checked before the file is
    read, so off WSL the plan is empty however `hosts.toml` reads, and an
    unrelated typo cannot defer a repair that has nothing to do. A `withheld`
    name is an **answer** and clears it — those rows never become classifiable, so
    waiting for the claim to disappear would just rewrite them once the
    evidence was gone, relabelling a live sibling's sessions local. Silence
    must never read as "no host claims this", though a machine with no
    `wsl.exe` at all is a definite "no distros", since interop puts `wsl.exe`
    on `PATH` inside a distro.
  - Discovery is consulted **only** for a candidate it could decide — never for
    `wsl:$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`, the spelling `wsl_hosts_from` filters out — so the
    ordinary repair spawns no `wsl.exe`, and its outcome does not depend on the
    machine having a working one. `with_discovered_wsl` pins the list in tests.

  `Database::apply_wsl_repair_plan` owns the SQL. `(host, repo_path)` is the
  bookmark key, so colliding readings of one path are resolved on recency —
  ties keep the row that is already local — before the survivor is rewritten,
  and the survivor inherits the group's `is_parent`/`parent_path` so a healed
  parent keeps the mark its children hang off.
- **Selection**: `SessionConfig.backend` (`ssh:<host>` / `wsl:<distro>` or `None`
  = local). The TUI new-session flow shows a **host picker** first (skipped when
  none configured/discovered); the chosen host runs git worktree creation +
  branch listing on that host.
- **Worktrees**: `git::*_on(host, …)` variants run `git` via the host launcher
  (`git::host_launcher` → `ssh …` or `wsl.exe …`). Worktrees live under the
  host's `worktrees_dir` (or `$HOME/.local/share/talos/worktrees` resolved +
  cached per backend name — a WSL distro has no `destination`).
- **Persistence/restore**: `backend_type` round-trips in SQLite; restore
  discovers windows **per backend** so off-local sessions re-adopt against their
  own host. In v2 there is no separate restore pass: a session is adopted when a
  pane first asks to paint it, and readying its backend, discovering its window
  and attaching all happen on `kernel::terminal`'s attach worker — the sharpest
  teeth in the loop, since a down host runs out its ssh timeout. So an
  unreachable or slow host never blocks a frame, and nothing is readied that
  nothing is looking at (ADR-P7/ADR-P12, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`).
- **A connection already open is still not something the loop waits on**
  (ADR-P24). A link that has gone bad stays open and carries nothing, so no ssh
  timeout fires and a round trip made from the loop runs out `COMMAND_TIMEOUT`,
  reconnects and runs out again. The two the loop makes are bounded or removed:
  the pane resize behind a paint is **sent, not asked**
  (`ControlMode::send_command_detached` — a place kept in the waiter queue with
  the receiver dropped, which is what `send_command_nowait` lacks), and the
  passthrough gate's deadness question gets `LOOP_COMMAND_BUDGET`. Both go through
  `tmux_compat::Server::ctrl_command_within`, which bounds the wait for the **control lock** as well
  as for the answer — one backend is one connection is one serialized queue,
  shared with the mirror pass and the attach worker — and neither reconnects,
  because a reconnect is a fresh handshake plus a synchronous read of the
  implicit attach response.
- **Several instances on one server size a pane by turns (ADR-27).** A paint's
  resize is honoured only for a window whose `@talos_sizer` is this backend's
  (or nobody's, or when it is the only client attached); input into a pane not
  at this instance's size claims it (`claim_size`), and so does the pane
  gaining the focus (`Terminals::focus`, on the edge only). Every grid follows the
  pane's real size from `%layout-change`, in stream order
  (`PaneSize`). The conditional list answers with **five** `%begin` blocks
  either way — `send_command_detached` is told the count, because an `if-shell`
  adds a block per command it runs. psmux keeps last-writer-wins.
- **Headless**: `talos-cli session create --host <name>` spawns on the host
  (an SSH name or an auto-discovered WSL distro name).
- **The agent's `PATH` on a host** (`agent::host_path`). ssh/`wsl.exe -e` give
  a command a non-login `PATH`, and a delegated `session create` pins its own
  `PATH` on the pane (`tmux_compat::server::path_prefix_args`), so the host's login `PATH`
  (`$SHELL -lc` + `/bin/sh -lc`, probed once per host, cached, failures
  included, bounded by `timeout` and a 15 s kill) is assigned in front of every
  POSIX script `host_cli` runs and inside `login_wrap_for_remote`: hosts.toml
  `path_prepend`, then the login shells', then the launcher's, de-duplicated.
  No answer = no change plus a warning. Tests never probe: an unseeded host is
  "no answer" under `cfg(test)`; seed one with `host_path::seed`.
- **Shared sessions (ADR-24).** A shareable host (`share_sessions = true`, the
  default) owns the record of the sessions on it: its **own talos database**.
  A remote talos *mirrors* that database into local rows on `ssh:<name>`
  (`session_ops::mirror` — same id, the host's facts and hook status; every
  10 s from a worker in `kernel::terminal` — 60 s after a pass that could not
  run, since a `Yes` verdict is cached for the process lifetime and a host that
  has since gone down would otherwise run its ssh out to the connect timeout six
  times a minute — right after anything it delegated, and from `automation
  tick`), and performs create/delete/restart/restore by
  running `talos-cli session …` **on the host** (`session_ops::host_cli`,
  branched inside the four pipelines so every caller delegates). A host with
  no CLI is **provisioned** one under `~/.local/share/talos/bin/` (the
  release archive of this version, checksum-verified; a dev build ships its
  own sibling binary when the platform matches), and `host_cli::provision`
  asks that binary for its version before reporting success — the checksum is
  taken here, nothing checks what landed there. The probe's protocol carries
  `@status <n>` so a CLI that died on a signal, one whose output could not be
  read and no CLI at all are told apart (`host_cli::ProbeFailure`), and a host
  that answered with a **broken** CLI re-provisions instead of backing off:
  the cached `No` skips the mirror pass, and the mirror is the only caller
  that reaches provisioning, so the bad binary used to disable its own repair.
  But a talos running on the host **advertises its own CLI** there first
  (`host_cli::advertise_running_cli`, a symlink refreshed at TUI boot and on
  every CLI call), which is how a host running a dev checkout is shareable
  without any provisioning. That advertiser only ever manages a symlink of its
  own — it never writes a regular file there, so it is never the thing that
  leaves a half-written binary at that path: it
  returns when the running CLI *is* the path it advertises into — which on a
  provisioned host it is, `resolve_cli_binary` answering with a sibling of the
  running exe — leaves a regular file there alone, and removes an existing
  self-referential link on sight, since nothing else repairs one (issue #1193). `version --json` reports the
  host CLI's `tmux_socket`, which the backend adopts
  (`backend::instance::learn_host_socket`) so a dev laptop attaches to a release host's server.
  Kept per host, not per route: it names the host's talos instance, which
  every multiplexer there runs under.
  Everything below this bullet — the hooks rewrite, remote provisioning, the
  pane-option status channel — is the **legacy path** for a host that cannot
  be delegated to (no artifact, no network, schema mismatch, `share_sessions =
  false`); `session create` then reports `sharing` and `session sync --adopt`
  registers such rows on the host later. `session signal` also sets the pane
  option, so tmux hosts keep sub-second status. Relaunch after a reboot is the
  host's (`session restart --if-missing`). A fork stays on the legacy path.
  Docs: `docs/FEATURES.md` → Shared sessions.
- **Agent config on the host**: agent args referencing talos-managed config
  by *local* path (the hooks extension's `--settings <config>/hooks/
  claude.json`) would kill the remote agent on launch ("Settings file not
  found"). `session_ops::spawn::adapt_def_for_launch` (shared by headless
  spawn and the TUI, run on the spawn worker — never the UI thread) rewrites
  them per host: on a POSIX remote the home-anchored path is **translated to
  the remote home**, the file copied there, and the arg substituted. A
  **Windows-local** config root (`C:\…` — the Windows TUI driving a WSL distro)
  has no absolute counterpart to mirror, so it lands under the remote
  `$HOME/.config/<root-name>` (final component = dev/release isolation), with
  `\` honoured as a separator **only** for such a root (it is a legal POSIX
  filename char) since the injected arg mixes them (`C:\…\hooks/claude.json`).
  On a route whose backend reports no status channel
  (`SessionBackend::hook_signal_command` is `None` — psmux today) or a failed
  home lookup/copy the **flag+path pair is stripped** so the agent launches
  clean — surfaced as a `Hooks: degraded` row in the info panel
  (`SessionInfo.hook_wiring`). Literal signal commands carried directly in
  args (aider's `--notifications-command`) are rewritten too.
  The local-location env hints
  (`TALOS_METRICS_DIR`/`TALOS_CONFIG_DIR`/`TALOS_DATA_DIR`, and
  `TALOS_SOCKET` — the host's sessions are on the host's own server) are
  likewise skipped for remote spawns (`inject_talos_env`); only the opaque
  identity vars travel.
- **Remote session status** (hooks-driven, like local, **all agents**) is the
  **route's backend's** (ADR-32): every step below is a `SessionBackend` verb,
  so nothing in `session_ops`/`cli` names a multiplexer. RMUX supplies its own
  channel by answering them; a future Herdr adapter would do the same.
  `talos-cli session signal` can't work from a host (no CLI there; it would
  write the host's own DB), so hook commands are **rewritten**
  (`builtin_hooks::rewrite_hook_signals`) to the command the row's backend
  hands out (`hook_signal_command`). For tmux that is `tmux set-option -p
  @talos_state <s>` — no socket, pane id or identity needed inside a pane;
  psmux's form would bake in `-L <socket>` (sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`).
  `None` = no channel: no hook config is shipped (the flag+path is stripped,
  config-dir payloads are not provisioned) and the session shows `Hooks:
  degraded` — **unknown, never idle**. Delivery per agent: claude's hooks file
  travels via its `--settings` arg; agents wired through their **own config
  dir** (codex, antigravity, opencode, vibe, copilot, grok, kimi) are
  provisioned at spawn time by
  `session_ops::remote_hooks::provision_agent_hooks_on_host` — the rewritten
  payload shipped into the host's agent config dir with the local installer's
  safety rules (`requires_dir` probe over ssh, prune-then-merge for a shared
  config — JSON on a content marker, TOML (kimi) on the same ownership comment
  used locally, see `talos-extensions`), managed-marker guard for standalone
  files, compare-before-write; cached per `(backend, agent)`, best-effort,
  never fails the spawn; remote **cleanup** is a documented leave-behind;
  Windows hosts are skipped there because the payloads run through `sh`).
  **Live**: a tmux-protocol connection subscribes once per connection
  (`refresh-client -B 'talos-status:%*:#{@talos_state}'`, armed in
  `ControlMode::start` so reconnects re-arm; the wire names live in
  `backend::tmux_compat::control_mode`) and receives `%subscription-changed`
  pushes (≤1/s); a **remote psmux or RMUX** connection instead runs a 1 s
  **poller thread** (`control_mode::diff_polled_hook_states`) — armed only when
  its channel is open. Both feed `take_hook_state_events`, drained each tick by
  `Terminals::drain_hook_events` into the same `set_hook_state` columns local
  signals use — so Done→seen acknowledgment, OS notifications, and the
  stuck-`working` fallback are shared. Events are matched by **backend name +
  pane id** (pane ids collide across hosts), allow-listed (pane-controlled
  text), and deduped against the cache. **Headless**: the live channels die
  with the interface, so `automation tick` (the 60 s heartbeat) groups live rows
  by the route they settle to and asks each route's backend `hook_states()`
  (`session_ops::remote_hooks::poll_hook_states`) — remote and local routes
  alike, so a session a peer created here on a non-default local server is
  polled too — allow-listed and diffed against the stored `hook_state`. A route
  nothing serves, a backend with no channel, or one that did not answer is
  skipped and keeps its held state. `session signal` also calls
  `record_hook_state` on the row's own pane, so a peer attached to that backend
  sees it live and the next poll does not undo it. **psmux carve-out**: the
  adapter's channel is closed (`Psmux::HOOK_STATUS = false`) until
  `scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh test`'s probes prove psmux's per-pane options;
  those probes read the gate from `talos-cli runtime status --json`
  (`hook_status["local:psmux"]`, the binary's own answer — never the source)
  and **fail** the harness when psmux disagrees with it in either direction
  (issue #1170 — psmux 3.3.6 implements no per-pane user options at all). No
  live psmux host has exercised this path.
- **Remote teardown** (WSL inherits the SSH path): `session delete --force`
  teardown is **backend-aware** — `teardown_runtime_resources` kills the
  session's windows through the backend its route names
  (`session_ops::windows::kill_owned`: `locate` then `kill`) and, for a remote
  session, removes each worktree via `git::remove_worktree_on(Some(host), …)`
  (local sessions keep the local `remove_worktree` + Windows pane-reap path).
  Every kill is resolved from the window's own `@talos_session` stamp, not the
  row's pane id or its name (ADR-25) — the host's tmux server reissues pane ids
  when it restarts, so a remembered `%N` there can be a live namesake's pane;
  the panes an `Owner` remembers are the psmux fallback only. An unreachable host or a
  missing `hosts.toml` entry is recorded in
  `ForceDeleteReport.remote_teardown_error` (surfaced in the CLI JSON) and the
  row is still soft-/force-deleted — a host that is down is often *why* someone
  force-deletes, and refusing there would be the worse answer. Like local
  force-delete it removes the worktree *directory* only, leaving the branch.
  `wsl.exe`'s exact arg-passing isn't verified in CI (no WSL runner); the
  construction is unit-tested (`transport::tests::wsl_*`, `git_command_wsl_*`).
- **A remote teardown that never reached its host is owed, not abandoned.**
  Recording the failure used to be the end of it, and for a `force_deleted`
  row that meant forever: every reaper skips such a row, and the mirror's
  tombstone push needs a shareable host with a usable CLI — so on the legacy
  path the agent, its window and its worktree survived the session for good.
  `finish_locally_with` now writes the failure onto the row (schema v46's
  `sessions.teardown_owed`, `ForceDeleteReport.remote_teardown_owed`,
  `session list --deleted`'s `teardown_owed`) and
  `session_ops::retry_owed_remote_teardowns` finishes the kill and the worktree
  removals when the host next answers — delegating `session delete --force` to
  a host that runs its own talos, killing through the stamp otherwise, and
  falling through to the direct kill when the host answers "Session not found".
  Driven beside `reap_overdue_soft_deletes` (`automation tick` and the
  interface's `Command::Reap`), reading `hosts.toml` afresh so adding the
  missing entry is enough to make the job possible again, and asking a silent
  host **once per pass** so a machine that is still down costs one connect
  timeout rather than one per orphan. Force-deleted rows only: a soft-deleted
  one is restorable and its windows are the reaper's at the end of the undo
  window — ADR-24, ADR-26.
- **A host the reap sweep cannot list is backed off, not re-asked.**
  `reap_overdue_soft_deletes` gates every row on window ownership, and
  `window_index_on` reads an unresolvable or unreachable host as "owns
  nothing" — correct for one pass, but the row is then never reaped, so the
  host was re-probed on the sweep's own five-second cadence for the life of
  the process. `window_index_on` now records the failure and leaves the host
  alone for `host_cli::retry_after` its consecutive failure count, the same
  minute-doubling-to-fifteen curve the usability probe climbs; an answer
  clears the count. The state is a durable `metadata` row
  (`host_probe_backoff:<backend>`) claimed under one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, not a
  process-local map: the interface reaps on a fresh thread every five seconds
  without waiting for the last, and the heartbeat reaps in a **new process**
  every minute, so an in-memory gate is overtaken by the first and forgotten by
  the second. Issue #1182 is what that cost on native Windows: one WSL
  row, `wsl.exe` spawned from the interface's own `Command::Reap` every five
  seconds, and 3.9 MB of log in a day. The **reap** is claimed the same way and
  per row (`session_reap_backoff:<session id>`), because a host can answer
  `list-windows` while its own `talos-cli` will not run: the listing succeeds,
  the row keeps owning its windows, and only the reap fails (issue #1193). That
  is why `reap_remote` returns a `Result` rather than logging — "still owns
  windows" cannot tell a reap that has not run from one that failed.
- **"The host holds nothing" and "the host did not answer" are different
  answers**, and the teardown is where confusing them costs the most.
  `discover` gates on `has-session` and reads its failure as an empty server,
  so a force delete taken while a host was briefly down found nothing to kill
  and recorded *no error at all*. `tmux_compat::Server::discover_answered` (what
  `discover` runs with no control mode open, and what `locate` and
  `rename_windows` list with) answers empty only on the multiplexer's own
  refusal, and drops the `has-session` round trip while it is there. It is
  what `restart --if-missing` asks to decide whether to relaunch after a
  reboot — an unreachable host now aborts the relaunch instead of reading as
  "no window", which used to start a second agent beside the one still running
  once the host answered again (`restart_if_missing_probe`).
- **The layer decides, not the wording.** Both classifiers started as substring
  matches, which is the same conflation one level down: the first unanticipated
  message lands in the wrong branch silently. `ssh` exits **255** for its own
  failures and passes a remote command's status through untouched, and
  `talos-cli` only ever exits 1/2/3 — so 255 means the question never
  arrived, whatever stderr says (`listing_is_absence`,
  `host_cli::classify_failure`). `host_cli::Reach` names the three answers —
  `Unreached` / `Answered` / `Undetermined` — and the third is its own answer,
  never rounded to the nearest of the other two. `wsl.exe` has no 255
  convention, so a WSL host is never `Unreached` on a status alone.
  **Do not widen `mux_answered_absent`**: it is narrowed to the exact answers
  tmux and psmux are documented to give, and each extra string makes it more
  confidently wrong about the next one nobody anticipated. In particular
  `error connecting to` is not a prefix match — only `(No such file or
  directory)` is absence; `(Permission denied)` / `(Connection refused)` /
  `(Connection reset by peer)` are a server that may be alive behind a socket
  that cannot be opened right now.
- **An unclassifiable failure takes whichever branch destroys nothing**, which
  is not the same branch in both places. A listing must not turn "unanswered"
  into "holds nothing", so it errors and the teardown is owed. A *delegated
  delete* is the reverse — aborting reaches nothing and records nothing, which
  made a session on a host with a broken CLI undeletable — so `Undetermined`
  falls back to the local teardown beside `Unreached`, and only `Answered`
  aborts (the host heard the question and refused; the session may still be
  running there). An older host that reports failures on stderr rather than as
  the structured document still reads as `Answered`, from its exit code.
- **Known limit**: tmux's absence is a claim about the *socket*, not the
  machine — a server with live panes whose socket is moved reports `(No such
  file or directory)`, verified against a real host with two processes still
  running. talos reaches sessions only through that socket, so no retry could
  ever discharge such an owed teardown; closing it would need a session's
  processes to be identifiable without the multiplexer (a recorded OS pid per
  remote pane, or a scan by worktree cwd), which nothing here has today.
- **A session owns two windows**, and every teardown takes both: the agent
  (`tb-`) and the companion shell (`tbs-`). The shell is found by its stamp
  (`@talos_role = shell`) rather than by `sessions.shell_backend_id`, which is
  written only once the interface has actually opened one — so the column is
  NULL for nearly every remote row, and a teardown keyed on it left a live
  `tbs-` window behind for good. `stop` and `restart` take it down too; the
  interface reopens one on demand.
- **A remote teardown never starts a server.** `ensure_ready` creates the
  multiplexer server *and* the talos session as a side effect, so a one-shot
  `talos-cli` tearing a session down used to leave an empty server on the
  host. With no control mode open, `locate` / `discover` / `kill` read one
  `list-windows` (`discover_answered`, above) and kill with a one-shot
  `kill-pane`. And they only act on a socket the host has vouched for:
  `known_host_socket` takes `hosts.toml`'s `socket`, else what the host's own
  CLI reported (`learn_host_socket`), else — for a host with `share_sessions =
  false`, where nothing but this talos writes there — this build's default.
  A **shareable** host that has reported nothing is refused with "socket
  unknown for host '…'", because this build's default is a guess about someone
  else's machine (a dev build aims at `talos-dev`; a relocated data dir
  derives its own name).
- **A remote soft delete is reaped on the host.** `reap_soft_deleted` no longer
  gives up on a remote row: it asks a shareable host to collect it
  (`talos-cli session reap <ref>` there, which owns the host's own row), and
  otherwise kills the windows itself through the stamp. Driven by the one sweep,
  `reap_overdue_soft_deletes` — the TUI's loop calls it on a slow cadence and,
  with no interface open, the heartbeat's tick does — which gates a remote row
  on the *host's* window listing,
  exactly as it gates a local one on this machine's. Without it every soft
  delete of a remote session (the TUI's default) leaked its `tb-`/`tbs-` pair
  forever, and re-creating the name put a second agent beside the first.
- **A local tombstone beats a host-active row** unless the host wrote the row
  *after* this database's own last-known reading of that host's clock for the
  row. `session list` carries `updated_at` for exactly this; `mirror::apply`
  compares it with the snapshot `sessions.host_updated_at` was last given
  (schema v45), not with the local `deleted_at` — the host's `updated_at` and
  this machine's `deleted_at` are two different clocks, and comparing them
  directly let a host whose clock merely ran behind this one look
  not-yet-restored and get re-deleted. Reports the losers in
  `MirrorReport.tombstoned`, and `mirror_host` pushes each as a `session delete`
  to the host — the symmetric counterpart of `register_unknown`. Before that, a
  delete taken while the host's CLI was in backoff was undone on the next mirror
  pass, forever.
- **Hosts of hosts: one row per session id, the direct path wins.** A host
  lists what it mirrors from its own hosts beside its own sessions (its
  `backend_type` is then `ssh:`/`wsl:`). `mirror::reconcile_with` (the database
  half of `mirror_host`) takes a host's own rows as
  always and a **transitive** one only when no other backend here holds that
  id, active or deleted — so A → C beats A → B → C, a B mirroring A back never
  relabels A's local rows, and a direct delete is not revived through B. A
  transitive row gets `backend_id = ""` (the far host's pane id names another
  agent on B's server; remote rows attach to their stored id unsurveyed) and
  borrowed worktrees (`created_by_talos = false`, so a fallback teardown on
  B removes nothing). `settings.toml` `[remote] transitive_sessions = false`
  (`Transitive::Hide`, read per pass by `settings_config::load_quiet`) takes
  only own rows and **forgets** the transitive ones held on that backend
  (`Database::forget_session`, event reason `forgotten`) — never a tombstone,
  which the next pass would push to B as a delete of a live session.
  `tests/shared_sessions.rs` pins it over three real databases.
- **A delegated delete the host does not know falls through** to the local
  teardown instead of erroring: a fork minted here, a pre-ADR-24 row, or one a
  peer already deleted there all make the host answer "Session not found", and
  aborting left the local row active and attached. The fall-through is recorded
  in `ForceDeleteReport.host_unknown`. A call whose `host_cli::Reach` is not
  `Answered` — `Unreached` or `Undetermined` — falls through the same way,
  recorded in `host_unreachable` instead: the row is still marked, and the
  local teardown that runs in the host's place owes its own retry
  (`remote_teardown_owed`) when it cannot reach the same down host either.
  Only `Answered` still aborts — the host heard the question and refused, and
  the session may still be running there.
- **Local e2e**: `scripts/dev/e2e/linux-container.sh up` spins a throwaway Podman
  container (sshd + tmux + git) and `… test` asserts a session lands on the
  `ssh:podman` backend (state under `target/`, never touches your real
  `~/.ssh`/`~/.config`). Its `remote_teardown_probe` is where the owed teardown
  is proven end to end on a real process: create a session on the container,
  point `hosts.toml` at a dead port, force-delete (which must still work),
  bring the host back, and assert the tick's sweep killed the window *and*
  reaped the pid it was running. It keeps sharing off throughout — with it on,
  a host whose CLI has vouched for no socket is refused by
  `known_host_socket`, which is a different behaviour and would hide this one.
  `restart_if_missing_probe` covers the sibling fix: create a session, point
  `hosts.toml` at a dead port, assert `restart --if-missing` refuses rather
  than relaunching against a host it cannot reach, then bring the host back
  and assert exactly one agent window exists — never a second one started
  while the host looked absent.
