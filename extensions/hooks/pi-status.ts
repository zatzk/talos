// This is a pi extension (TypeScript), auto-discovered from
// ~/.pi/agent/extensions/*.ts by the pi.dev CLI. It subscribes to pi's
// lifecycle events and reports them to talos's status reporter:
//   session_start → idle, agent_start + tool_execution_start +
//   tool_execution_end → working
//   (a tool call to ask_user_question → blocked), agent_end → done.
