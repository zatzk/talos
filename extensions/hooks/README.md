# hooks — agent lifecycle → talos session status

The **hooks** extension wires each coding agent's lifecycle hooks to
`talos-cli session signal` so every session reports its state back to talos
and the sidebar shows, at a glance, which agents are **blocked**, **working**,
or **done**:

| State | Colour | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 🔴 blocked | red | the agent needs input or approval |
| 🟡 working | yellow | the agent is actively running |
| 🔵 done | blue | a turn just finished; shown until you switch away |
| 🟢 idle | green | acknowledged (you moved off it), or at rest |

Repo groups in the session list roll up to their most-urgent member, so the
whole list scans in one pass.

## It's on by default

Unlike most extensions, **hooks ships built into talos and is auto-activated**
on first run — the default agent's hook is pre-configured with zero setup.
(`ui-skill` is the other one built in this way.) Opt out at any time:

```bash
talos-cli extension deactivate hooks   # remove the wiring; won't come back
talos-cli extension activate hooks      # re-enable it
```

## How each agent is wired

The hook command is always `talos-cli session signal --state <working|blocked|done>`,
which identifies the calling session from the injected `$TALOS_SESSION` (no ids
passed by hand) and is suffixed `|| true` so it can never break the agent.

Every command also **redirects its own output away** (`>/dev/null 2>&1`). A hook's
stdout is a pipe, and down a pipe `talos-cli` answers in TOON — which the agent
then reads as something it was told. claude, codex, grok and antigravity fold a
hook's plain-text stdout into the model's context, so the signal's receipt was
being billed to you on every prompt and every tool call; codex goes further and
**fails** a `Stop` hook whose stdout is not JSON (*"hook returned invalid stop hook
JSON output"*), which is why its `Stop` command ends in `echo '{}'` — the no-op
decision. If you wire your own agent (see *Wiring an agent talos doesn't know*
below), do the same.

- **claude** — a managed settings file (under the extension home) is passed via
  `--settings` (an `[[agent_patches]]` that appends the flag to the built-in
  `claude` agent, reversibly). claude merges it with your own settings, so your
  hooks are preserved. Events: `SessionStart` → idle (so a just-booted, idle
  session isn't shown as working), `UserPromptSubmit`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`
  → working, `Stop` → done. `Notification` → blocked **only for
  permission/approval prompts** — claude also fires `Notification` for its
  "waiting for your input" idle nudge, which the hook ignores (matches the
  notification's `message` field alone, not the whole payload — `cwd` and
  `transcript_path` are the operator's own directory names, and globbing them
  too false-fired `blocked` on that idle nudge whenever the checkout path
  happened to contain a word like "permission") so an idle session doesn't
  flip to red. `PostToolUse` is what clears
  that block: claude has no "permission granted" event, so the tool finishing is
  the first thing it reports after the prompt is answered — without it an
  approved session stayed red until the *next* tool call, or until `Stop` if the
  turn had no more.
- **aider** — `--notifications-command` reports the only edge aider exposes:
  blocked (waiting for input).
- **opencode** — a plugin dropped into `~/.config/opencode/plugin/` (only when
  opencode is installed). Events: `session.created` → idle, `chat.message` →
  working, `permission.asked` → blocked, `permission.replied` → working
  (allowed or denied, the turn is opencode's again — it is the only agent here
  with a real permission-reply event), `session.idle` → done.
- **codex** — codex's `hooks.json` is claude-shaped, loaded from
  `~/.codex/hooks.json`. We **JSON-merge** our entries in (a `[[config_merges]]`,
  guarded by `requires_dir`) so your own hooks are preserved; uninstall prunes
  exactly ours back out. `SessionStart` also binds the reported Codex
  conversation ID to the Talos row, so restart can address that conversation
  exactly. Events: `SessionStart` → idle,
  `UserPromptSubmit`/`PostToolUse` → working, `PermissionRequest` and
  `PreToolUse` matching `request_user_input` → blocked, `Stop` → done. **Both**
  block edges are **structured** — a real approval event and a real tool call,
  so unlike claude/antigravity nothing is inferred from the text of a
  notification — and `PostToolUse` is the edge back out of either. The second
  one is the questions plan mode asks: codex fires no approval event for them,
  the turn just sits inside the `request_user_input` tool until you answer.
  `PreToolUse` is used for nothing else, because it fires *before*
  `PermissionRequest` (so an unmatched `working` group never cleared a block)
  and codex runs an event's hooks concurrently (so it could not be kept beside
  the matched one without racing it). The matcher is matched against the whole
  tool name, which is what keeps the non-blocking `request_user_input_async` out
  of it. `Stop` must print JSON on a zero exit (`echo '{}'`, the no-op
  decision; its schema is `deny_unknown_fields` and takes only `decision`/`reason`
  plus the universal fields), or codex fails the turn. Verified against
  codex-cli 0.154.0 over real turns — approval prompt and question included, and
  a bare `request_user` matcher confirmed not to fire. This replaced the
  old `-c notify=…` override (which only reported done); the trade is a
  reversible write into a separate `~/.codex/hooks.json`, never your
  `config.toml`.
- **vibe** *(experimental)* — Mistral Vibe loads hooks from `~/.vibe/hooks.toml`.
  It's TOML, so we can't JSON-merge it — we drop a managed file in (an
  `[[external_files]]`, guarded by `requires_dir`, only when vibe is installed).
  Verified against vibe 2.21.0 (`vibe.core.hooks.models.HookConfig`): each entry
  needs `name` + `type` (`pre_tool`/`post_tool`/`post_agent`) + `command`. Events:
  `pre_tool` → working, `post_agent` → done. **No blocked** — vibe's only hook
  types are pre_tool/post_tool/post_agent (no permission/notification event),
  so a tool awaiting approval reads as `working` (`pre_tool` fires *before* the
  approval prompt). If a future vibe renames the types/fields, edit
  `vibe-hooks.toml` (no code change). And if you already maintain your own
  `~/.vibe/hooks.toml`, the write is **refused** (no managed marker) so it's never
  clobbered — vibe simply goes unreported rather than broken.
- **copilot** *(experimental)* — GitHub Copilot CLI (the `copilot` command) loads
  hooks from its own dir, `~/.copilot/hooks/*.json`. We drop a managed standalone
  file in (an `[[external_files]]`, guarded by `requires_dir`, only when copilot is
  installed), so your other hook files are never touched. Events (copilot's own
  schema): `sessionStart` → idle,
  `userPromptSubmitted`/`preToolUse`/`postToolUse` → working, `agentStop` → done,
  and `notification` matched to `permission_prompt` → blocked (so an
  `agent_idle`/`shell_completed` notification doesn't flip the dot red).
  `postToolUse` is what clears that block — copilot has no "permission granted"
  event, so the tool completing is the first thing it reports once the prompt is
  answered.
  Both `bash` and `powershell` commands are shipped, so status works on Windows
  too. **Caveat:** if a future `copilot` changes the hook schema, edit
  `copilot-hooks.json` (no code change).
- **grok** *(experimental)* — xAI's Grok Build CLI loads every `*.json` in
  `~/.grok/hooks/` on its own, so we drop a managed standalone file in (an
  `[[external_files]]`, guarded by `requires_dir`, only when grok is installed)
  and never touch a hook file you wrote. It is the **global** dir on purpose:
  those hooks are always trusted and load on first launch, while
  `<project>/.grok/hooks` additionally needs the folder granted trust in grok's
  own `~/.grok/trusted_folders.toml`. grok is Claude-Code-compatible, so the
  mapping mirrors claude: `SessionStart` → idle,
  `UserPromptSubmit`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` → working, `Notification` →
  blocked **only for permission/approval prompts** (the `message` field alone
  is matched, not the whole payload, so an idle nudge doesn't flip the dot
  red), `Stop` → done. Every command here is
  `$`-free: grok silently refuses to load a whole hook file whose command
  references `$VAR` without an inline `:-default`, so the blocked edge
  extracts the message and pipes it through `grep` rather than reusing
  claude's `case`. **Caveat:**
  if a future grok renames its events, edit `grok-hooks.json` (no code change).
- **kimi** *(experimental)* — Kimi Code CLI reads hooks from a `[[hooks]]` array
  in `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`. That one file is your whole kimi configuration
  and there is no drop-in hooks dir, so a managed file would clobber it — we
  **merge** our entries in instead (a `[[config_merges]]` with `format = "toml"`,
  guarded by `requires_dir`); `toml_edit` keeps your comments and key order, and
  uninstall prunes exactly ours back out. Events: `SessionStart` → idle,
  `UserPromptSubmit`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` → working, `PermissionRequest` →
  blocked, `PermissionResult` → working, `Stop` → done. This is the one agent
  here whose block edge is structured on **both** sides — a real permission
  request and a real permission result — so `blocked` neither false-fires on an
  idle notification nor latches until the next tool call. **Caveat:** kimi
  accepts exactly four keys per hook entry (`event`/`command`/`matcher`/
  `timeout`) and refuses to load the entire config file if it sees a fifth, so
  `kimi-hooks.toml` must never grow one.
- **antigravity** — antigravity (the `agy` CLI, the Gemini CLI successor) loads
  hooks only from its shared `~/.gemini/settings.json`, so we **JSON-merge** our
  entries in (a `[[config_merges]]`, guarded by `requires_dir`) without clobbering
  your settings; uninstall prunes exactly ours back out. `agy` adopted Claude
  Code's hook schema (verified against agy 1.0.9), so the mapping mirrors claude:
  `SessionStart` → idle, `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` → working, `Stop` → done, and
  `Notification` → blocked **only for permission/approval prompts** (the
  `message` field alone is matched, same as claude, so an idle `Notification`
  doesn't flip the dot red);
  `PostToolUse` clears the block, for claude's reason. It has no
  `UserPromptSubmit`, so working is signaled at the first tool call rather than on
  prompt submit. **Caveat:** if agy sanitizes the hook environment,
  `$TALOS_SESSION` may not reach the hook, in which case the signal is a
  fail-open no-op. If a future `agy` changes the hook schema, edit
  `antigravity-hooks.json` (no code change).
- **pi** *(experimental)* — the pi.dev CLI auto-discovers TypeScript extensions
  from `~/.pi/agent/extensions/*.ts`, so we drop a managed extension in (an
  `[[external_files]]`, guarded by `requires_dir`, only when pi is installed). It
  subscribes to pi's lifecycle events: `session_start` → idle, `agent_start`,
  `tool_execution_start` and `tool_execution_end` → working, `agent_end` → done,
  and a tool call to `ask_user_question` → blocked. There is no "answered"
  event, so `tool_execution_end` is what clears that block: the question tool
  finishing *is* the answer arriving. **Caveats:** pi has no claude-style
  `Stop`/permission hook, so `blocked` is inferred only from a structured
  `ask_user_question` tool call — a turn that ends by asking something in prose
  signals `done`, not `blocked`. If you already maintain your own file at that
  path the write is **refused** (no managed marker), so it's never clobbered — pi
  simply goes unreported rather than broken. Remote (SSH/WSL) pi sessions are
  provisioned like the other config-dir agents (the rewritten payload ships
  into the host's extensions dir); a psmux/Windows host shows `Hooks: degraded`.
  If a future `pi` renames its events, edit `pi-status.ts` (no code change).
- **omp** *(experimental)* — Oh My Pi (`omp`) is Pi-compatible and likewise
  auto-discovers TypeScript extensions, from `~/.omp/agent/extensions/*.ts`, so
  we drop a managed extension in (an `[[external_files]]`, guarded by
  `requires_dir`, only when omp is installed). It mirrors pi's status extension
  but maps OMP's structured user-question tool — named `ask` — to `blocked`;
  it recognizes **both** `ask` and pi's `ask_user_question`, so reusing pi's
  file unchanged would leave OMP stuck `working` while it waits. Events:
  `session_start` → idle, `agent_start`/`tool_execution_start`/
  `tool_execution_end` → working (`ask`/`ask_user_question` → blocked, cleared
  by that tool ending), `agent_end` → done. Same caveats as pi
  (managed-marker refusal, remote provisioning, psmux `Hooks: degraded`).
  Verified against OMP 17.0.6; if a future `omp` renames its events, edit
  `omp-status.ts` (no code change).

## Agents this extension does not wire

Two agents have a hook surface none of the three mechanisms can reach, so they
are left out rather than given a payload that never fires — `session get` keeps
saying `hook_coverage: "none"`, which is the truth:

- **cursor** (`cursor-agent`) — the only scope its CLI is known to load
  `stop`/`sessionStart` from is per-project `<repo>/.cursor/hooks.json`, and only
  when launched with `--trust`. That is a per-repo file plus a launch flag, so it
  would cover nothing an outside driver starts. User-scope `~/.cursor/hooks.json`
  is documented for the IDE; in the CLI it is reported to run only the
  shell/MCP/file-edit hooks — none of which can say `done`, so wiring it there
  would latch a session at `working` forever.
- **muse** (Muse Code) — its hooks exist only as capabilities of a native plugin
  that must be installed *and approved* with `muse plugins install` / `muse
  plugins approve`; a dropped-in config file is silently ignored. An extension
  manifest writes files, it does not run an agent's commands.

## Custom agents (`hook_schema`)

The wiring above is keyed to the built-in agent **names**, so a **custom** agent
you add to `agents.toml` (e.g. a rebranded-claude `fleet`) normally gets no
hooks — its status dot stays driven only by the agent-neutral fallbacks (working
inferred from output, done from output quiescence). To opt a custom agent into a
known family, set `hook_schema` on its `[[agents]]` entry:

```toml
[[agents]]
name = "fleet"
command = "fleet"        # runs claude under the hood
hook_schema = "claude"   # ⇒ inherit claude's --settings hook wiring
```

talos then applies the `claude` `[[agent_patches]]` to `fleet` as well, so it
reports working/blocked/done exactly like `claude` (locally and on a remote/WSL
host). `hook_schema` names the *family* to imitate; today `"claude"` is the
useful value — it's the family wired via a per-agent arg patch. The
config-dir-wired families (codex/opencode/antigravity/vibe/copilot/grok/kimi)
don't need it: a rebrand that runs the same CLI reads the same `~/.<agent>/…`
hook file and already reports.

**grok and kimi are wired without being built-in agents.** talos ships no
`agents.toml` entry for either, but their payloads land in their own config dirs
all the same — so a grok or kimi started from a `--command` shell, from your own
`agents.toml` entry, or by an outside driver reports state like any built-in.
Tell talos which agent the pane is really running so the row resolves that
coverage:

```bash
talos-cli session create --name x --repo-path … --agent shell --reports-as grok
talos-cli session reports-as <ref> kimi     # or --clear to take it back
```

## Where the config lives

The wiring is applied **only to agents talos launches** — it never edits your
own global agent config (e.g. your personal `~/.claude/settings.json`). For
claude the managed hooks file is passed with `--settings`, which claude **merges
on top of** your own settings: inside a talos session both your hooks and
talos's fire, while a plain `claude` outside talos sees only your own. The
other agents are wired by a reversible merge into — or a managed file dropped in
— their own config dir.

| Agent | On-disk location | How it's applied |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| claude | `~/.config/talos/hooks/claude.json` | `--settings` flag on the `claude` agent (claude merges it) |
| aider | — (no file) | `--notifications-command` flag on the `aider` agent |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/plugin/talos-status.js` | managed plugin file (`requires_dir`) |
| codex | `~/.codex/hooks.json` | reversible JSON-merge of our entries |
| vibe | `~/.vibe/hooks.toml` | managed file (refused if you already have one) |
| copilot | `~/.copilot/hooks/talos-status.json` | managed standalone file (`requires_dir`) |
| antigravity | `~/.gemini/settings.json` | reversible JSON-merge of our entries |
| pi | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/talos-status.ts` | managed extension file (`requires_dir`) |
| grok | `~/.grok/hooks/talos-status.json` | managed standalone file (`requires_dir`) |
| kimi | `~/.kimi-code/config.toml` | reversible TOML-merge of our entries |
| omp | `~/.omp/agent/extensions/talos-status.ts` | managed extension file (`requires_dir`) |

The home dir is `~/.config/talos/hooks` for a release build and
`~/.config/talos-dev/hooks` for a dev build, so the two stay isolated.

**Inspect or customize.** To see exactly what talos installed, read the file
for the agent above (e.g. `cat ~/.config/talos/hooks/claude.json`). The
injected `--settings` / `--notifications-command` flags themselves live in the
`claude` / `aider` entries of `~/.config/talos/agents.toml`. You can hand-edit
a managed file, but self-heal rewrites it from the embedded payload on the next
TUI start / heartbeat tick — so to keep a change, either deactivate the extension
(`talos-cli extension deactivate hooks`) and wire the hook yourself, or edit
the payload source under `extensions/hooks/` and reinstall.

## Checking that it fires

Every hook command ends in `|| true` on purpose — a missing `talos-cli`, a
locked database, or a hook firing outside a talos session must never break the
agent. The cost is that a signal which never lands looks exactly like an agent
that simply has not signalled yet:

```bash
talos-cli session doctor          # every active session
talos-cli session doctor <uuid>   # just one
```

It reports whether this extension is active, what the session's agent can report
at all, whether its payload is really on disk where the agent reads it, whether
a hook command could resolve `talos-cli` on `PATH`, what was last reported and
how long ago, and whether the pane's foreground process agrees. It exits
non-zero when a session's wiring is broken (an uncovered agent that is
signalling anyway warns rather than fails), and only ever reads —
`talos-cli extension reinstall hooks` is the repair.

## Reporting state for an agent talos did not launch

These hooks are wired at **launch**, for an agent talos knows from
`agents.toml`. A harness that owns the agent launch itself — asking talos for
a bare interactive shell and starting the agent inside that pane — gets none of
them. It can still report state, because `TALOS_SESSION` is set on the pane
and inherited by every process in it:

```bash
talos-cli session signal --state working >/dev/null 2>&1   # identity from $TALOS_SESSION
talos-cli session signal --state done >/dev/null 2>&1
```

Keep the redirect: a hook's stdout is a pipe, so without it `talos-cli` answers
in TOON straight into whatever your agent does with a hook's output.

You can put that hook in a file talos also merges into — `~/.codex/hooks.json`,
`~/.gemini/settings.json` — including under an event talos's own payload uses.
Talos recognises its own entries by a `# managed by talos …` stamp in the
command, not by the `session signal` call, so yours is left alone however many
times it re-merges. Two caveats: don't copy that stamp into your own command, and
if you were already running talos before hooks 1.11, move your hook out of the
file once — the first install after upgrading sweeps unstamped entries out of the
events it owns, because that is the only way to remove the broken commands older
versions left there.

`extension deactivate hooks` is the blunt one: it prunes every entry in the file
carrying the `session signal` command, yours included.

Point your own agent's lifecycle hooks at that and the session reports exactly
like a built-in. Failing even that, talos reads the pane: a session that never
signalled but whose foreground process is an agent your `agents.toml` knows
reports `state: "running"` with `state_source: "process"` — coarser than a hook
by design, but not silence.

## Mechanism

This extension exercises two extension-manifest capabilities (see
`src/session/extension_def.rs`):

- `[[agent_patches]]` — append args to an **existing** agent in `agents.toml`
  (reversible; uninstall removes exactly the injected subsequence).
- `[[external_files]]` — place a file into an agent's **own** config dir
  (outside the extension home), guarded by `requires_dir`.
- `[[config_merges]]` — **reversibly deep-merge** a shipped document into an
  agent's own *shared* config file (antigravity's `~/.gemini/settings.json`,
  kimi's `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`) without clobbering the
  user's other settings: objects/tables recurse, arrays union, and uninstall prunes
  exactly the entries we shipped. JSON recognises them by the `session signal`
  marker in their content; TOML by an ownership comment stamped on each entry,
  which is stricter in both directions — a hook *you* wrote that calls `session
  signal` is not ours and survives uninstall, and an entry of ours whose event or
  command changed in a later payload is still ours and gets replaced rather than
  duplicated. Guarded by `requires_dir`; no-op when
  the merge is already present. A merge whose target is malformed is
  soft-skipped (logged, never aborts the rest of the install). JSON by default;
  `format = "toml"` picks the TOML merge (`agent::toml_merge`, on `toml_edit`,
  so the user's comments and key order survive).

  Note: on the **first** merge, talos rewrites `settings.json` with normalized
  formatting (alphabetized keys, 2-space indent). This is one-time and lossless —
  your values are untouched and the file is stable afterward.

## Remote (SSH/WSL) sessions

`talos-cli` isn't installed on a remote host, so the shipped hook commands
are rewritten there to set a tmux **pane user option**
(`tmux set-option -p @talos_state <s>`) that the local TUI picks up over its
control-mode connection. Delivery per agent, at spawn time:

- **claude** — the `--settings` hooks file is copied to the host (rewritten)
  and the arg substituted.
- **aider** — its literal `--notifications-command` arg is rewritten in place.
- **codex / antigravity / opencode / vibe / copilot / grok / kimi** — the rewritten payload
  is provisioned into the host's agent config dir
  (`session_ops::remote_hooks`), with the same safety rules as the local
  install: skipped when the agent isn't installed there (`requires_dir` probed
  over ssh), deep-merge-not-clobber for a shared config (prune-then-merge so
  upgrades replace rather than accumulate — JSON on either the `session
  signal` marker or the backend's own hook command in an entry's content, TOML on the same
  ownership comment used locally, which recognises a stale entry under either
  command form), managed-marker guard for standalone files, and
  compare-before-write.

The local TUI receives the state through the row's backend while attached;
with the TUI closed, the headless `automation tick` (the 60 s heartbeat) asks
the backend of every route with live sessions for its panes' states and writes
changes to the same database columns, so status keeps flowing either way.

Provisioning is **best-effort** (a down host or refused write degrades to a
`Hooks: degraded` hint in the info panel — never a failed spawn) and
**one-way**: talos never uninstalls from remote hosts (same policy as remote
worktrees). The files it leaves carry both prune markers, so removing them by
hand — or a future remote prune — needs no schema knowledge. Windows hosts are
not provisioned: these payloads run through `sh`, and claude's forward-slash
`--settings` path there is unproven. psmux's own status channel is also closed
(`Psmux::HOOK_STATUS`) until psmux is proven to carry it.
