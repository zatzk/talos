// Managed by talos `extension install` (the built-in "hooks" extension).
// Reinstalling or updating overwrites this file — do not edit; uninstalling
// removes it. Reports Oh My Pi's lifecycle state to talos. Identity comes
// from the inherited $TALOS_SESSION env var; every call is best-effort so it
// can never break a session running outside talos.
//
// This is an OMP (Oh My Pi, https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) extension
// (TypeScript), auto-discovered from ~/.omp/agent/extensions/*.ts by the omp
// CLI. It subscribes to OMP's lifecycle events and reports them to talos's
// status reporter:
//   session_start → idle, agent_start + tool_execution_start +
//   tool_execution_end → working
//   (a structured user-question tool call → blocked), agent_end → done.
//
// OMP is Pi-compatible, but its structured user-question tool is named `ask`
// (upstream pi uses `ask_user_question`). We treat BOTH as blocking so the dot
// turns red while OMP waits for the user instead of staying yellow (working).

import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent";

// Tool names that block the turn until the user answers.
const BLOCKING_TOOLS = new Set(["ask", "ask_user_question"]);

// Exact marker prefix kept on one line so the remote (SSH/WSL) rewrite can swap
// this command for a tmux pane-option setter (there is no talos-cli on a
// remote host). Do not split the words across lines or reorder the flags.

// the agent. exec inherits the OMP process env, so $TALOS_SESSION travels.

// runtime, so this file has no hard dependency beyond Node's built-ins.
