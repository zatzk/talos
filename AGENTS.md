# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working in this repository.

## Project

Talos is a multi-session coding-agent TUI orchestrator built
with Rust. It runs multiple coding-agent CLI instances (Claude
Code, Codex, Antigravity, opencode, aider, … — any CLI you
define) inside persistent tmux sessions, rendered as terminal
panels via ratatui + tui-term. Sessions survive crashes/restarts
because tmux keeps the processes alive.

Each session picks **which agent** to run from a declarative
registry (`~/.config/talos/agents.toml`). Talos is
agent-neutral: it knows nothing about any agent's model,
permissions, prompts, or tools — only how to launch the CLI with
the right `command + args`. Each agent uses its own default
config (bake a model or other flags into the agent's `args` if
you want them).

## Build & Development Commands

The reproducible dev environment is a **Nix flake** (`flake.nix`, pins the Rust
toolchain + tmux/shellcheck/node/cargo-tools/just/demo stack) — enter it with
`nix develop` (or `direnv allow` once; see `.envrc`). Non-Nix fallback:
`scripts/install-dev-tools.sh`. Task entrypoint is **`just`** (`justfile`); full
guide in **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`**.

```bash
just build                           # cargo build --bin talos --bin talos-cli
just test                            # cargo nextest run --all
just lint                            # fmt-check + clippy + deny + rumdl + shellcheck + the 3 Lua gates

cargo check --all                    # Type check (bare cargo still works)
cargo build --release                # Release build (LTO, stripped)
```

To **run talos in an isolated sandbox** use `scripts/dev/sandbox.sh` (a.k.a.
`just sandbox*`). By default it does **talos-only isolation**: redirects only
talos's config/data into the sandbox (via the `TALOS_CONFIG_DIR`/
`TALOS_DATA_DIR` overrides paths.rs honors) while keeping your real `HOME` —
so your authenticated agent CLIs (claude/codex/…) work — and puts dev
`target/debug` first on PATH so an agent hook's `talos-cli` hits the sandbox DB.
It also names the sandbox's tmux socket outright (`TALOS_SOCKET`, `=
$TBX_DEV_SOCKET`): a relocated `TALOS_DATA_DIR` otherwise derives one of its
own, and teardown kills the socket *by name*.

```bash
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh               # persistent "default" profile, launch the TUI
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --fresh       # throwaway env, wiped on exit
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --isolate-home    # full hermetic isolation (fresh HOME; agents have no creds)
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --shell       # shell with the sandbox env (run talos-cli by hand)
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh -- session list   # run a talos-cli command in the sandbox
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --clean       # wipe the persistent profile
```

The TUI is launched **from the sandbox root rather than the repo**:
the sandbox sets `TALOS_CONFIG_DIR`, so the interface materialises at
`<sandbox>/talos-config/ui/` along with everything else and `--fresh` gives you a
clean one per run. (This used to matter more: `resolve_ui_dir` preferred a `./ui` in
the working directory, so a sandbox started from the repo isolated the database but
not the interface. That rule is gone, and the `cd` is now belt-and-braces.)

The isolation lives in one helper, `scripts/dev/lib/sandbox-env.sh`
(`tbx_sandbox_init` = talos-only, `tbx_sandbox_init_full` = full HOME/XDG),
sourced by the sandbox entrypoint plus `scripts/demo/record.sh` (which uses the
full flavor). Single source of truth for the `talos-dev` sandbox pattern;
`tests/tui_e2e.rs` isolates the same way in Rust.

## Working reference (skills)

The per-subsystem reference that used to live in this file is now **eleven
skills** under `.agents/skills/`, loaded on demand instead of on every turn.
Every skill's body lives there, agent-neutrally; `.claude/skills/<name>` is a
relative symlink into it, so Claude Code and opencode read the one copy.
Each carries its subject verbatim, so a section named elsewhere in the repo
("the *Agent Definitions* section of AGENTS.md") is now the skill on this list
that names it. Read the one your change touches:

| Skill | Owns (the sections that moved) |
|---|---|
| `talos-testing` | Testing · Kernel and interface tests · Session-backend e2e harnesses |
| `talos-performance` | Performance (render loop) |
| `talos-release` | Release Process · Distribution Packages · Installation Script |
| `talos-agents` | Agent Definitions · Multi-repo sessions |
| `talos-remote-hosts` | Remote SSH & WSL Sessions |
| `talos-cli` | talos-cli · lifecycle hooks · parent sessions · ordering · messages · Tasks |
| `talos-extensions` | Extensions · Extension manifests + self-heal |
| `talos-session-status` | Session status (hooks-driven) · OS notifications |
| `talos-kernel` | Architecture (plugin kernel) · Writing an interface plugin |
| `talos-ui-surfaces` | Keybindings · Themes · Settings panel · Global search · Code review |
| `talos-demo-media` | Demo Video |

Two more are unrelated to this split and predate it: `ui-review` (screenshot
the TUI and critique it) and `talos-ui` (edit the *running* interface's Lua,
installed by the `ui-skill` extension into each coding CLI).

A skill is a working reference, not an owner: the docs under `docs/` still own
the rationale, and the **Rule** at the bottom of this file applies to a skill
too — a change that invalidates what one says updates it in the same PR.

## Linting & Formatting

```bash
cargo fmt --all                      # Format (rustfmt: 100 char max)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings  # Lint
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features  # Docs
rumdl check .                        # Markdown lint (.rumdl.toml)
rumdl fmt .                          # Markdown auto-fix
selene ui                            # Lua lint (selene.toml + talos.yml)
stylua ui                            # Lua format (stylua.toml); --check in CI
# A RELATIVE --configpath resolves against the server's own install dir, is
# silently not found, and then reports every injected global as undefined (79
# phantom findings). `just lint` passes an absolute one:
lua-language-server --check ui --configpath "$PWD/.luarc.json" --checklevel=Warning
scripts/ci/check-lua-types.sh        # the definitions' own test (see below)
scripts/ci/check-lua-std.sh          # the standard library's own test (see below)
```

Three tools on `ui/`, chosen to match what the Lua ecosystem actually gates on —
**stylua** and **lua-language-server** are what neovim's own lint job runs. Each
covers a different half of the sandbox, and both halves matter:

| tool | catches | enforces absence of |
|---|---|---|
| `selene` | undefined variables, shadowing, `talos.*` typos | `print`, `dofile`, `load*` (base functions) |
| `lua-language-server` | type errors, undefined fields, unused locals | `os`, `io`, `debug`, `package` (libraries) |
| `stylua` | formatting | — |

The split is not redundancy: selene's `removed:` works on plain functions but not
on a table's fields, and luals' `runtime.builtin` disables whole libraries but
cannot drop a single base function. Verified by probing every withheld capability
against both.

**`ui/lib/talos.d.lua` is the API as types**, and is what gives luals something
to check names against: node props and their allowed values, `ctx`, the
`hit`/`key`/`wheel` payloads, the declaration table, every published `talos.*`
row, every `command` verb's options, and the theme roles. Declarations only —
nothing loads it into the VM, which is why `selene.toml` excludes it (describing a
global means assigning one, the single thing the sandbox forbids a plugin).

`.luarc.json` names it in `workspace.library` for an editor opened at the
repository root. `--check ui` does not need that entry — luals loads a `---@meta`
file that is inside the workspace it is checking — which is also why the file
ships in `BUNDLED` and works in a user's own interface directory with no config
at all. The relative library path resolves against the workspace ROOT, not the
working directory, so it is spelled for the root the repository is opened at.

luals will **not** flag an extra key in a table constructor, so the file catches a
typo the other way round: each kind and each verb declares the field it cannot work
without, so a misspelt one reads as `missing-fields`, and each field drawn from a
fixed set is spelled as that set, so a misspelt value is `assign-type-mismatch`.
`scripts/ci/check-lua-types.sh` runs three panes from `tests/fixtures/lua_types/`
that each make one of those mistakes and fails if any stops being reported —
`--check ui` alone would also pass against a file describing nothing.

**`talos.yml` is the plugin sandbox, checked statically.** It is selene's
standard library for `ui/`, and it deliberately declares **no `base:`** — it lists
only what `kernel::host::plugin_stdlib` grants (`string`, `table`, `math`,
`coroutine`, `utf8`) plus the six globals `install_api` injects. So `os`, `io`,
`debug`, `package`, `print` and the loaders are *absent* rather than marked
removed, which is the same shape the VM enforces and means a plugin
reaching for one fails lint instead of failing at runtime. Inheriting a base and
marking things `removed` does **not** work: selene applies that to plain functions
but not to a table's fields, so `os.time()` passed review while `dofile` was
caught.

It also declares the published shape of `talos`, so `talos.sesions` is a lint
error rather than a silently-nil pane. Keep it in step with **both** publish
paths: `LuaHost::publish`, and `LuaHost::enter`, which sets `talos.runs` and
`talos.granted` per plugin and is easy to miss because it is not named
"publish". A newly published field used by a plugin fails lint until it is added. selene
checks a **dotted** path one segment at a time and stops at the first `[…]`, so a
table read as `talos.platform.os` needs an entry per field while a list read as
`talos.sessions[i].name` stops at the list. `selene ui examples` cannot notice a
table left at the table — no bundled pane reads one by name — so
`scripts/ci/check-lua-std.sh` runs the panes in `tests/fixtures/lua_std/`:
`reads.lua` reads every field on `granted`, `platform`, `metrics`, `hover`,
`preflight.mux`, `settings`, `theme.roles`, the four creation-flow reads and
`runs` and must lint clean, and `typos/` holds one pane per table
misspelling one field, each of which must not. The assertion is selene's
`incorrect_standard_library_use` code out of its `Json2` output, and the table a
finding belongs to is the file it was found in — neither depends on the wording
of a message, which a selene release could change under us.

## Comments

Comments are context for the next reader — human or LLM agent. Each one must earn
its tokens; a redundant or wrong comment makes agents *less* accurate, not more.

- **Why, not what.** Explain rationale, tradeoffs, non-obvious constraints, and
  invariants the code can't show. Never restate what the code plainly does.
- **Accuracy is non-negotiable.** A stale comment (describes a prior impl, a wrong
  signature, or behavior the code no longer has) is *worse than no comment* — it
  anchors readers on the wrong intent. When you touch code, fix or delete the
  comments around it; never leave one contradicting the code.
- **Keep** design rationale, cross-references (`see fn_x`, `mirrors Y`), and
  `ADR-*` / `schema vNN` anchors (they point at `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` /
  `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`). **Cut** restatements, obvious trailing labels (`// list`,
  `// EOF`), and obvious test-step narration. If an LLM could infer it from the
  code, it doesn't belong.
- **Doc comments** (`///`/`//!`) document the public contract. Tighten verbose
  ones, but never delete a doc that carries intra-doc links (`` [`Item`] ``) or a
  ` ``` ` example without re-running `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc`
  (CI fails on a broken link/example).
- **Formatting is automatic** — `rustfmt` wraps comments at 80 cols
  (`wrap_comments`); write content, let `cargo fmt` handle width.
- This repo uses **no `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK` markers** and keeps **no commented-out
  code** — track work in issues, delete dead code.

## Website Linting

```bash
npm ci                               # Install deps (use lockfile)
npm run lint:website                 # Run all website linters
npm run fmt:website                  # Auto-fix formatting (Prettier)
```

## Architecture Enforcement

```bash
cargo test --test architecture_rules                      # Arch rules
cargo deny check advisories                               # Advisories
cargo deny check bans licenses sources                    # Dep policy
```

## Conventional Commits

Pull requests land by **squash merge**, so the commit on `main` is
built from the pull request **title** plus GitHub's own `(#N)`
suffix — not from any commit on the branch. That title is what
`cog bump --auto` reads for the release decision and what the
changelog quotes, and `.github/workflows/pr-title.yml` (the required
`PR Title` check, via `scripts/ci/check-pr-title.sh`) is the only
thing that validates it. Title the pull request after its most
significant change.

Branch commits are held to the same convention locally by the
`commit-msg` hook, for a legible history; nothing in CI checks them,
because the squash throws them away.

- **Types**: feat, fix, perf, refactor, docs, style, test,
  chore, ci, build, revert
- **Scopes**: api, cli, ui, git, core, docs, deps, config, mcp
- Use `cog commit feat "message"`
  or `cog commit fix "message" scope`

## Module Dependency Rules (enforced by tests/architecture_rules.rs)

```text
node                 may reference                     [fully-qualified path only]

agent                agent::{generic,provider} (re-exports only)

  ::control_mode     shell, backend::contract,
                     backend::tmux_compat::transport
  ::server           session, paths, shell,            (the shared server,
                     agent::{host_path,preflight},      generic over the mux)
                     backend::{contract,identity,

backend::psmux       session, shell, backend::{contract, (the psmux adapter —
                     instance},
                     backend::tmux_compat::{control_mode, a peer, never tmux's)
                     server,transport}
backend::rmux        session, shell, backend::contract, (the RMUX adapter)
                     backend::tmux_compat::{control_mode,
                     server,transport}
git                  session, paths, shell

                     paths, workspace, shell            backend::{contract,identity,
                                                        instance,registry}]
kernel               session, storage, sync, paths,    [agent::<the config it reads>,
                     session_ops, git, notifications,   backend::{contract,identity,
                     shell                              pane,registry}, usage]
cli                  session, storage, session_ops,    [agent::<the config it reads>,
                     sync, paths, notifications,        backend::{contract,instance,
                     ui_control                          registry}, kernel]

clipboard            session, paths
workspace            paths
paths                nothing — leaf utility
ui_control           paths
shell                session (HostLauncher::for_host)
coordinator          agent::{input,settings_config},   (main's body: the loop,
                     backend::{output_wake,
                     wiring}, clipboard, kernel,        the workers, the chrome)
                     paths, session, session_ops,
                     shell, storage, ui_control
```

Enforcement is an **allowlist** over **resolved** edges: every module under
`src/` needs a `ModuleRules` entry naming what it may reference in *any* form, so
a new module fails the test until its place is declared, and one loop asserts
every entry, so no rule can be declared and left unchecked. A node is a top-level
module or a governed submodule (every file module of `backend` and of `agent`
is one), and a
reference counts where it resolves — through `super::`, brace groups, re-exports
and `type` aliases. Both the actual and the declared graph must be acyclic, an
unused grant fails, and the crossings still scheduled for removal are listed,
item by item, in the test's `TRANSITIONAL` table, which must equal what the
source does — empty since status and the heartbeat went behind the contract
(ADR-32); `consumers_reach_no_concrete_backend` holds `session_ops`, `cli` and
`kernel` to reaching no adapter, protocol helper or factory.
`docs/CONSTITUTION.md` §2 lists the same graph. The full rule, the module
responsibilities and the event loop are in the `talos-kernel` skill.

## Pre-commit Hooks

18 hooks run automatically via `prek` (Rust-based pre-commit
framework). Install with `prek install`. Stages:

- **commit-msg**: conventional commit validation (`cog verify`)
- **pre-commit**: fmt, clippy, check, nextest, architecture,
  deny, doc, bats (the install script), shellcheck, rumdl, selene,
  stylua, prettier, htmlhint, stylelint, eslint

There is no **pre-push** stage: the hook that used it walked the
branch's commit messages, which squash merge discards.

The bats hook has a CI twin (`install-script`), so the suite that
guards that script is actually run rather than merely present.

Shell scripts are linted with **shellcheck** (config in
`.shellcheckrc`); install it from your package manager (it is not a
cargo crate — `scripts/install-dev-tools.sh` prints a reminder).

## Key Technical Details

- MSRV: 1.75, Edition 2021
- Async runtime: tokio (multi-threaded)
- Session backend: a tmux-protocol server per adapter — `TmuxBackend`
  (`backend::tmux`), `PsmuxBackend` (`backend::psmux`), and opt-in
  `RmuxBackend` (`backend::rmux`), peers over the
  shared `tmux_compat::server` (ADR-31) — over a `TmuxTransport`
  (local `tmux -L talos`, or `ssh <dest> tmux …` for
  `ssh:<host>` backends from `hosts.toml`). The local socket is
  `talos`/`talos-dev` only for an instance on the **default** data dir; one
  relocated by `TALOS_DATA_DIR` derives its own (`talos-<digest>`) so it
  never creates windows on the operator's server, and `TALOS_SOCKET`
  overrides both. `talos-cli version --json` reports the name in force —
  ADR-12, `docs/CONFIG.md` → Relocating an instance
- Output reader runs in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
  (blocking I/O), writer in `tokio::spawn` (async)
- Terminal state parsed by `vt100::Parser`,
  rendered by `tui_term::PseudoTerminal`
- Sessions persist across restarts (tmux keeps them alive)
- Session state in SQLite:
  `~/.local/share/talos/talos.db` (XDG_DATA_HOME respected);
  agent definitions in `~/.config/talos/agents.toml`;
  remote SSH hosts in `~/.config/talos/hosts.toml`;
  session lifecycle hooks in `~/.config/talos/hooks.toml`
- Requires tmux >= 3.2, psmux >= 3.3.7, or opt-in RMUX >= 0.10.0;
  version evidence and RMUX host limits are in `docs/CONFIG.md`
