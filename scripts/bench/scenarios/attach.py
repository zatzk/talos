"""Attach a client with N sessions running, detach, attach again.

``attach_ms``: from starting the client until it has drawn session 1's agent.
``detach_ms``: from the host's own leave key until the client process is gone
(talos's is Quit — the interface exits, tmux keeps the sessions).
``reattach_ms``: a second client, 3 s after the first left, with everything in
the page cache. (The gap matters for Herdr: one attaching within about a
second of a detach took ~280 ms on 0.9.1 instead of ~50.)
``survivors``: agents still running after the detach, out of N.
