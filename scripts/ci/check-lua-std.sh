# Prove `talos.yml` still declares the fields the kernel publishes on the
# injected tables a plugin reads by name.
#
# `selene ui examples` proves the bundled interface is clean, which a standard
# library declaring nothing about those tables would also achieve — and did:
# `talos.granted`, `.platform`, `.metrics`, `.hover` and `.preflight.mux` were
# declared as bare properties, so a dotted read off any of them was an
# `incorrect_standard_library_use`, while CI stayed green because nothing in
# `ui/` or `examples/` reads them in a form selene can see (issue #1133).
#
# The probes are what notices:
#
#   reads.lua  every field on those tables, as a plain dotted path. Must lint
#              CLEAN, so a table that regresses to a bare property fails here.
#   typos/     one file per table, each misspelling one field. Each must still
#              be reported, so the fix cannot be a wildcard that accepts
#              whatever is asked for.
#
# Both halves are asserted on a positive result rather than on the absence of
# one, so a selene that never linted a probe — a renamed or deleted file — fails
# instead of passing quietly. That is why the loop names its probes instead of
# globbing, and why declaring a further table takes a file here *and* its name in
# that list.
#
# This covers those five tables, not everything `LuaHost::publish` serves — a path
# stops being checked at the first `[…]`, so a list has nothing below it to probe.
#
# Read through selene's `Json2` display style, and asserted on the `code` field.
# That code is selene's own lint identifier — the same name `selene.toml`'s
# `[lints]` keys and a `-- selene: allow(…)` comment use — so it is a contract
# rather than prose. An earlier version grepped the message text ("does not
# contain the field"), which a selene release could reword into a gate that
# passes every probe while catching nothing. Which table a finding belongs to
# comes from the file it was found in, not from that text, which is why `typos/`
# is a file per table.
#
# Run from the repository root: selene resolves the `std` name against the
# working directory, not the directory of the config it was given, so the `cd`
# below is what makes `selene.toml`'s `std = "talos"` find this repository's
# `talos.yml`.
