# Prove `ui/lib/talos.d.lua` still catches the mistakes it exists to catch.
#
# `lua-language-server --check ui` only proves the bundled panes are clean,
# which a definitions file describing nothing would also achieve. These probes
# are the other direction: three panes that each make one of the silent failures
# the plugin API allows — a node prop the kernel drops (`convert.rs` ignores an
# unknown key), a command option no verb reads (`command/mod.rs` reads a fixed
# list), and a theme role no palette defines (`theme.lua`'s `__index` answers
# nil) — and each must come back as a finding rather than as a pane that draws
# the wrong thing and says nothing.
#
# The probes run in a throwaway copy of `ui/` rather than in the tree, because
# lua-language-server resolves both `require("lib.…")` and the relative entries
# of `workspace.library` against the workspace ROOT — a probe checked from
# anywhere else would type-check against no definitions and pass for the wrong
# reason. Copying also keeps them out of `--check ui`, which must stay clean.
#
# Usage: check-lua-types.sh
