// v2 specifically: asciinema 3 writes v3, whose lines carry *intervals* rather
// than the absolute timestamps this reads, so a cast from it would be trimmed to
// nonsense rather than refused. record-doom.sh pins asciinema 2.x for that reason.

// Used by record-doom.sh to cut the Doom window out of a recording that also
// contains talos booting and Doom's own title screen and first attract demo.
// Everything before `start` is collapsed into one instant chunk at t=0, so frame
// 1 already shows the fully painted screen instead of replaying the boot.
