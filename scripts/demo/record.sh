# Regenerate ALL Talos demo media in one pass, using REAL coding-agent CLIs.
#
# This single script records every feature clip under media/:
#
#   * talos-interface.{gif,mp4}       (interface.tape       — panes are files)
#   * talos-theme.{gif,mp4}           (theme.tape)
#   * talos-session-creation.{gif,mp4}(session-creation.tape)
#   * talos-fork.{gif,mp4}            (fork.tape)
#   * search-demo.{gif,mp4}             (search.tape)
#
# The hero demo (talos-demo.*) is not a tape: scripts/demo/record-hero.sh
# records it, because it needs a right press and a remote host, neither of
# which VHS can drive.
#
# Every clip drives the actual `claude`, `opencode`, `codex` and `antigravity` CLIs —
# one per talos session — to showcase real multi-agent orchestration. No prompt
# is sent to any agent; they are launched and left on their start screens.
#
# Isolation (so this never touches your real talos, tmux, or agent accounts):
#   * HOME points at a throwaway dir  -> agents boot with NO chat history (no past
#     conversations leak into the video). To avoid login/trust dialogs on screen,
#     each CLI's auth *token* is copied into the throwaway HOME and every demo repo
#     is marked trusted (see "Seed agent credentials + pre-trust" below). Only the
#     token is copied, never history; auth files absent for a CLI you are not
#     logged into are simply skipped. No account email/handle is shown on screen:
#     codex surfaces no identity when logged in; antigravity (agy) and claude are
#     both featured LOGGED OUT on purpose, because each prints your account email
#     in its welcome box when signed in (agy fetches it from the server via its
#     keyring auth; claude prints the org name) — see their notes below.
#   * TMUX_TMPDIR points at a throwaway dir -> the `talos-dev` tmux server lives
#     in its own socket directory, so cleanup can't kill dev sessions you already
#     have running.
#   * XDG_{DATA,CONFIG,STATE,CACHE}_HOME point at a throwaway dir.
#
# Requirements: cargo, git, tmux, sqlite3, jq, vhs (+ ffmpeg + ttyd) and whichever agent CLIs
# you want to feature (claude / opencode / codex / antigravity). Missing agents are
# skipped with a warning.

# --- Rebindings for the recording -------------------------------------------
# Two real chords cannot be driven by VHS+ttyd, so they are rebound for the demo
# only. Everything else keeps its declared default.
#
#   * search  — really Ctrl+/ (plus the Ctrl+7 / Ctrl+_ raw-0x1F encodings the
#     kernel folds into it), none of which arrive reliably across terminals.
#   * settings — really F6 or Ctrl+, and VHS can send neither an F-key nor a
#     Ctrl+punctuation chord. Ctrl+B rather than Ctrl+S: `sessions.sync` already
#     declares Ctrl+S, and a rebinding that collides is a conflict the registry
#     has to resolve rather than an override.
#
# The kernel reads rebindings from `ui.json`, as `bindings: { action: chord }` —
# the same file that carries trust and the disabled set, because those are all
# *user decisions* (v1 used a separate keybindings.json with arrays of chords).
# Written before first launch so the registry picks it up on the first frame.
#
# The two example panes are rebound for the same reason: they declare F5 and F7.
#
# --- The example plugins, so the clips show them ----------------------------
# `examples/` is not bundled, and the demo it forms is the clearest thing
# talos has to show: two panes nobody shipped, stacked beside the agent by an
# arrangement anybody can copy. Installed here so the recording is of the real
# files rather than a mock-up of them — if an example stops loading, the clip
# breaks and somebody notices.
#
# `layout.lua` IS bundled, so this copy has to happen BEFORE the first launch:
# `materialize` preserves a file that differs from the shipped one with no
# manifest record, which is exactly this case. Copied after, it would be
# overwritten on the run that mattered.

# --- The demo repo: a vendored snapshot of talos's own tree ----------------
# The demo repo is a fixed subset of THIS repository, copied into the throwaway
# HOME and `git init`ed there.
#
# Why talos's own code rather than a synthetic "sample-project" (or a cloned
# third-party repo):
#   * It shows real work. The old stub was four toy files (`fn add(a, b)`), so
#     every clip was a UI tour — nothing on screen told a viewer WHY you would
#     run four agents at once. Real modules, a real test and real docs make the
#     file viewer, the search results and the review diff legible as actual work.
#   * It is already on the recording machine, so recordings stay hermetic and
#     offline (no clone step to slow down or break a re-record), which is the
#     same property the throwaway HOME/XDG isolation buys elsewhere.
#   * Licensing is a non-question: talos is MIT and we own it. A GPL engine or
#     any third-party tree would put a license notice into the release pipeline's
#     demo assets for no benefit.
#   * It is self-demonstrating — the tool built with the tool.
#
# COPIED, not symlinked, and never the live checkout: the recording must not be
# able to mutate your working tree, and a fixed file list keeps successive recordings visually stable
# even as the real repo moves on.

# Pin a deterministic session order so the left column is byte-stable across
# runs. Tapes that walk the list with a FIXED number of Down presses (the
# `automations` clip steps past the last session to flow into the Automations
# pane) are only correct if the walk starts on a known row: the combined
# session+automations column is circular, so one press too many wraps back onto
# the list and the following keystrokes are forwarded to the focused agent's PTY
# instead — a broken clip that still exits 0. `display_order` is the authoritative
# ordering (a NULL sorts after ordered rows, in creation order), so stamping it
# 0..n-1 by creation time fixes both the order and which row is selected first.
# Put the demo repo in the repo picker's remembered list.
#
# Bookmarks are written when a repository is chosen THROUGH THE FLOW, so seeding
# sessions with `talos-cli session create` leaves the picker with nothing
# remembered. The only row it then offers is the interface directory, which it
# always offers — and that is what session-creation.tape selected for who knows how
# long: the clip created a session in `~/.config/talos-dev/ui`, its `w` and its
# typed name went to the agent's PTY, and the wreckage was still on screen when the
# next tape recorded.
#
# `is_git = 1` because the flow needs it to offer the worktree option; `use_count`
# and `last_used_at` are what a real bookmark would carry.
