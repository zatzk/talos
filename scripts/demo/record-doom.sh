#
# **Doom is a plugin now, not an agent.** This used to be recorded through the
# `pi` CLI and its `pi-doom` extension — a game pretending to be a coding agent
# to borrow the one field of the session model that spawns a pty. talos-doom
# asks the kernel for a *program pane* of its own (`Capability::Program`), so the
# recording needs no agent to install and no transcript tidied up on screen:
# install the plugin, grant it the capability, press `f7`.
#
#   https://github.com/zatzk/talos-doom
#
# Two consequences for the script below. The plugin arrives by **clone** (its WAD
# is binary, and the file-by-file fetch path decodes what it fetches as UTF-8),
# so recording needs the network once. And a `program` grant is a **decision made
# in a running interface** — there is deliberately no `talos-cli` for it — so the
# sandbox seeds the grant the settings modal would have written.
#
# Unlike the other demos this is not a VHS tape. VHS drives a TUI through
# ttyd + a headless browser; here the whole point is a *nested* TUI (talos
# rendering Doom), and the toolchain is lighter: asciinema records the real
# talos to an asciicast and agg rasterises it to frames. No browser.
#
# The clip is Doom's own attract demo, so nothing has to be played. The engine
# does handle held keys (it infers releases from auto-repeat timing, which is how
# it works around talos forwarding key *presses* but not *releases*), but
# scripting a level through `tmux send-keys` is a recording nobody can re-run and
# get the same footage from — the attract demo is the same every time.
#
# Requirements:
#   talos + talos-cli on PATH   (the binaries under test)
#   asciinema **2.x**, agg, ffmpeg, ffprobe, tmux, git, node, python3 (>= 3.11),
#   sqlite3. The 2.x pin is load-bearing: asciinema 3 records asciicast v3, an
#   interval-based format trim-cast.mjs does not parse — it reads v2's absolute
#   timestamps. `uv tool install 'asciinema==2.4.0'` is one way to get it.
#   network access, once, for the plugin clone (or point DOOM_PLUGIN_SRC at a
#   local checkout)
#   optionally any of claude / codex / opencode / agy — one session each, so the
#   session list beside Doom is not empty. Missing ones are skipped; their panes
#   never appear in the kept window, which starts long after `f7`.
#   a font directory for agg, which ships none. Point FONT_DIR at it. A Nerd Font
#   covers everything on its own
#   (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases -> JetBrainsMono.tar.xz);
#   otherwise the coverage to check is the session list's, not Doom's — the engine
#   only ever paints `▀`, while the rows carry the worktree mark `⑂` (U+2442) and
#   the working spinner's braille (U+2800..), which plain JetBrains Mono does not
#   have. What this clip was recorded with, as a working pair:
#     FONT_DIR   a directory holding JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf and
#                NotoSansSymbols2-Regular.ttf
#     FONT_FAMILY "JetBrains Mono,Noto Sans Symbols 2"
