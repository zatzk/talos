# Regenerate the onboarding tutorial's screenshots (media/tutorial/*.png).
#
# One PNG per step of docs/TUTORIAL.md, taken from the REAL TUI: this drives
# `Ctrl+N` through the creation flow the way a first-time reader does, so a step
# that stops looking like its screenshot breaks this script rather than quietly
# ageing the doc.
#
# It differs from scripts/demo/record.sh in three ways that matter:
#
#   * The profile starts with ZERO sessions and an EMPTY repo memory. The
#     tutorial's subject is the first launch, and a seeded list would show a
#     screen the reader cannot have yet.
#   * agents.toml is left for talos to seed, so the agent step shows the
#     built-in registry a fresh install really has. (Only when `claude` — the
#     seeded default — is installed; otherwise two stub agents are registered, so
#     the agent step is still reached rather than skipped.)
#   * It is NOT a VHS tape. VHS drives a TUI through ttyd and a headless browser;
#     stills need neither. talos runs in a detached tmux session, `tmux
#     send-keys` presses the keys, and each screenshot is `capture-pane -e`
#     rasterised by agg — the same asciicast→agg→ffmpeg chain
#     scripts/demo/record-doom.sh uses, minus the recording step. The consequence
#     worth knowing is that the REAL chords are pressed: VHS can emit neither
#     `Ctrl+/` (search) nor an F-key, so the tapes rebind them and the recordings
#     are of an interface nobody runs. Here `Ctrl+/` is sent as its actual byte.
#
# Isolation is the shared dev-sandbox helper, in its full flavor: a throwaway
# HOME/XDG/TMUX_TMPDIR, so this can touch neither your talos profile, nor your
# tmux server, nor your agent credentials.
#
# Requirements: cargo, git, tmux, agg, ffmpeg, python3, jq, sqlite3. A coding
# agent CLI is optional (see agents.toml above). agg ships no font, so FONT_DIR
# is provisioned under target/fonts: JetBrains Mono (whose box-drawing glyphs
# tile, which is what keeps a pane border from rendering as a dashed line), plus
# Noto Sans Symbols 2 for `⑂` (U+2442), the mark the session list puts on a
# worktree session. Both are fetched best-effort and fall back to a system
# DejaVu — a missing glyph is worth a box on screen, not a failed re-record.
#
# Usage:  scripts/demo/record-tutorial.sh [OUTPUT_DIR]
#
#   OUTPUT_DIR  where the PNGs go (default: <repo>/media/tutorial)
#
# Env: THEME (default doom), COLS, ROWS, FONT_SIZE, LINE_HEIGHT, FONT_DIR,
