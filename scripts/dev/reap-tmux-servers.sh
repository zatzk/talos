# Reap the test tmux servers a run left behind — the ones a guard could not.
#
# `tests/support/tmux_server.rs` kills a harness's server in `Drop`, which
# covers every way a test can end *in-process*: returning, asserting, panicking.
# It cannot cover a signal that runs no destructor — a nextest `slow-timeout`
# termination, a `kill -9`, a Ctrl-C at the wrong moment, an OOM kill. The
# server left that way keeps its agent processes, keeps its CPU, and loses its
# socket file with the directory the run owned, so `tmux -L <name> kill-server`
# has nothing to connect to. That is how one machine reached 400 orphans,
# 1432 processes and 4.4 GiB RSS (issue #1175).
#
# This finds them by process rather than by socket, and kills only servers that
# are BOTH one of the suite's own socket names AND unreachable — a server whose
# socket file still exists is one somebody can still use, including a test
# running right now, so it is left alone.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev/reap-tmux-servers.sh            # reap, reporting each one
#   scripts/dev/reap-tmux-servers.sh --dry-run  # list them and change nothing
#
# Linux only: the socket directory a server was started with is read from
# /proc/<pid>/environ, and there is no portable equivalent. On anything else it
# says so and exits 0 rather than guessing — a sweep that guessed would be a
# sweep that killed the wrong server.
