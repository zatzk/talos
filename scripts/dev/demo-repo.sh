# Seed a sandbox with a repository that has something to look at.
#
# `just sandbox` gives you a working talos with NOTHING in it — no repos, no
# sessions, no changes. Every feature that is about a repository (the review
# pane, the file viewer, sync, fork, the creation flow's branch list) is
# therefore untestable there until you hand-build a git repo, create a session,
# and commit onto its branch. This does that, once, reproducibly.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev/demo-repo.sh                  # seed the "default" profile
#   scripts/dev/demo-repo.sh --profile foo
#   scripts/dev/demo-repo.sh --fresh          # seed a throwaway sandbox
#   scripts/dev/demo-repo.sh --big            # add the large-diff repo too
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --demo             # seed, then launch the TUI
#
# Idempotent PER THING, not per run: the repository and each session are checked
# separately, so a session you deleted is recreated while the repository it came
# from is left alone.
#
# It never touches your real config: everything lands under the sandbox root
# (`repos/` beside `talos-config/`), so `--clean` takes it with the profile and
# `--fresh` gets a new one. Deliberately NOT under the config dir, where the
# interface's own inventory would find it.

# ── the agent ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A seeded session must not launch a real coding agent: it would want
# credentials, take seconds, and burn tokens for a demo. `sh` is a shell, which
# is all a demo session needs to exist and hold a pane.
#
# The user's `default` is NOT touched — a demo that quietly rewrites which agent
# every hand-made session gets is worse than a slow demo. `sh` is registered and
# named per session with `--agent sh`.
#
# Getting the file to exist at all is the awkward part: talos seeds
# `agents.toml` on first run and `talos-cli` has no verb that does it (only
# `session create` loads the agent registry, so only it seeds). So on a sandbox
# that has never been opened we force the seed with one throwaway session and
# delete it again. Worth knowing: an UNREGISTERED `--agent` silently falls back
# to the default, so skipping this step does not fail loudly — it quietly starts
# claude.
