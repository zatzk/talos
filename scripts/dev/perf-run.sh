# --- not inside a validation step -------------------------------------------
#
# This script builds a release binary, spawns a tmux server and N agents, and
# then deliberately sits still for -d seconds. That is the right shape for a
# measurement and the wrong shape for anything a gate runs: it looks like a test
# -- it is under scripts/dev/, it drives the real binary, it prints a result --
# so an agent asked to run the tests and gather evidence reaches for it, waits
# for it, and burns the step's whole budget. Not hypothetical: it timed out a
# gate's test step at 30m0s with the agent silent, having decided the intent's
# paired before/after reading was the evidence to gather.
#
# So it refuses, and says how to get the number instead. A benchmark that also
# generates load has no business running unattended inside a validation step --
# the reading would be meaningless there anyway, since the gate's own build is
# what the machine is busy doing. TALOS_GATE is the sentinel to export around
# any such step; it is deliberately not named after one tool, because the next
# gate is a different tool and the hazard is the same.

perf-run.sh: refusing to run inside a validation step.

This is a benchmark, not a test: it builds a release binary, runs agents for
tens of seconds and measures CPU. Its reading is only meaningful on a quiet
machine, and a gate is the opposite of one.

Nothing here needs it to pass. The deterministic coverage is ordinary tests --
`cargo nextest run --all` -- and the perf claims are asserted on counters and
change-signals in tests/kernel_frame_cost.rs and tests/kernel_perf.rs, never on
a clock (docs/PERFORMANCE.md, ADR-P5).

To take a reading by hand, on a machine you are not otherwise using:
    just perf -n 19 -p 3 -s 255x62
    just perf -n 19 -p 3 -s 255x62 -u 0     # the paired control

Set TALOS_PERF_ALLOW_IN_GATE=1 to override this, if you really mean to.
