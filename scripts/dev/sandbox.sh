# Run a talos *dev build* in an isolated sandbox — one command to launch the
# `talos-dev` TUI/CLI against a throwaway or persistent environment that never
# touches your real ~/.config/talos or tmux server.
#
# By default only *talos's own* config/data are redirected (via TALOS_*_DIR)
# — your real HOME/agents stay intact, so authenticated claude/codex/antigravity work.
# Pass --isolate-home for a fully hermetic env (fresh HOME, agents boot without
# credentials), e.g. to reproduce the demo/smoke conditions.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh                 # persistent "default" profile, launch the TUI
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --fresh         # throwaway env, wiped on exit
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --profile foo   # named persistent profile
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --isolate-home  # full isolation (fresh HOME; no agent creds)
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --demo          # seed a demo repo + sessions, then launch
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --demo-big      # …and the large-diff repo as well
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --shell         # drop into a shell with the sandbox env
#                                          #   (run `talos-cli ...` against the sandbox DB)
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh -- session list # run `talos-cli <args>` in the sandbox
#   scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --clean [name]  # kill + wipe a persistent profile, then exit
#
# The interface materializes at `<sandbox>/talos-config/ui/` along with agents,
# settings and the database, because TALOS_CONFIG_DIR points there — which is
# what `--fresh` then gives you a clean one of.
#
# A bare sandbox has NO repositories and NO sessions, which is the state most
# bugs are reported against and is worth keeping as the default. `--demo` opts
# into `demo-repo.sh`: a repository with one file of each git status, a session
# whose branch has changes, and a session whose branch deliberately has none.
#
# The TUI is still launched FROM THE SANDBOX ROOT rather than the repo. That used
# to be load-bearing: talos preferred a `./ui` in the working directory over the
# user's own copy, so starting from the repo isolated the database and not the
# interface. That rule is gone (standing somewhere no longer decides which
# interface loads), and the cd is kept as belt-and-braces.
#
# State (persistent mode): target/dev-sandbox/<profile>/ (gitignored). Sessions
# survive across runs — its tmux-dev server is left alive on exit. `--clean`
# (or `cargo clean`) removes it.
#
# Requires: cargo, tmux >= 3.2. Build happens before any HOME override so cargo
# still resolves your real ~/.cargo.
