# e2e: talos's Windows/psmux support against a throwaway Windows VM — the
# ephemeral-Windows member of the e2e family (see scripts/dev/README.md).
# Mirrors linux-container.sh: a single Podman container runs a real,
# KVM-accelerated Windows VM via dockur/windows, with an unattended first-boot
# script that installs psmux + OpenSSH so the harness can drive the VM headlessly
# over SSH — exactly like the Linux-container test drives its container.
#
# All state lives under target/windows-test/ (gitignored): the throwaway SSH
# keypair, the cached psmux release zip, the generated /oem setup payload, and
# the VM disk image. Nothing touches your real ~/.ssh or ~/.config.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh up      # build /oem payload + boot the VM (first run installs Windows, ~10-20 min)
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh wait     # block until the VM's SSH is reachable
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh test     # headless smoke test (asserts psmux + a control-mode session round-trip)
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh test-suite # run the FULL nextest suite inside the VM (cross-built archive)
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh ssh      # open a PowerShell shell inside the VM
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh deploy   # cross-build talos for Windows + copy the .exe into the VM
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh web      # print the browser viewer URL (eyes-on)
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh rdp      # print RDP connection details
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh logs     # follow container/install logs
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh down     # stop + remove the container (keeps the disk image)
#   scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh clean    # remove container + all local state (disk image included)
#
# Env overrides:
#   TALOS_WIN_SSH_PORT  (default 2223)   host port forwarded to the VM's :22
#   TALOS_WIN_RDP_PORT  (default 3389)   host port forwarded to the VM's :3389
#   TALOS_WIN_WEB_PORT  (default 8006)   host port for the browser viewer
#   TALOS_WIN_VERSION   (default 11) any dockur VERSION (11, 10, 2025, 2022, ...);
#                                       note: dockur has no "tiny" edition token.
#   TALOS_WIN_RAM       (default 4G)
#   TALOS_WIN_CPUS      (default 4)
#   TALOS_WIN_DISK      (default 64G)
#   TALOS_WIN_TEST_DIR  (default <repo>/target/windows-test)
#   PSMUX_VERSION         (default v3.3.6) psmux release tag to install in the VM
#   NEXTEST_VERSION       (default latest) cargo-nextest release to install in the VM
#
# Requires: podman (with /dev/kvm + /dev/net/tun), ssh, ssh-keygen, curl.
# Cross-build (deploy / test-suite) additionally needs the x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
# Rust target, the mingw-w64 toolchain, and (for test-suite) cargo-nextest on the
# host. No Rust toolchain is needed *inside* the VM: test-suite cross-builds a
# self-contained nextest archive on the host and runs it with cargo-nextest.exe.

# --- the psmux hook-status gate, and the probes that hold it to psmux -------
#
# Remote hooks-driven status on a psmux host is gated off in the binary (the
# psmux adapter reports no status channel, `Psmux::HOOK_STATUS`) until psmux is proven
# to do two things: (A) pane **user options** settable with `set-option -p -t`
# and expanded by `#{@opt}` in `list-panes -F` — the mailbox the status poller
# reads; and (B) an **id-less** in-pane `set-option -p` landing on the calling
# pane — what the rewritten hook command runs.
#
# The probes measure both halves and hold them against that gate. They used to
# report `ok`/`--` and never fail, which is how psmux dropping the option
# entirely sat unseen (issue #1170): a probe that passes on its own `ok` branch
# whichever way the measurement went is evidence of nothing.
#
# Those two are the mailbox, and the mailbox is not the whole gate: it also
# rests on claude accepting the forward-slash `--settings` path talos
# generates on Windows, which needs a real agent launch rather than a psmux
# capability check and is measured nowhere in this harness. It is named here so
# the verdict can say what it does not know, and so that giving it a probe is a
# change to one line.

# rather than restated or read out of the source, so there is one record of
# what talos believes and it is the behaviour: a gate flipped without this

  # A paste cannot be key-encoded for psmux (a split ESC arrives as a bare
  # Escape keypress, losing the ESC[200~ marker, and every embedded CR then
  # submits — issue #916), so talos hands pastes to psmux's own
  # `send-paste` (see `backend::psmux`'s `PsmuxPaste`). This probes the two
  # properties that path relies on: the payload is standard **base64**, and a
  # multi-line payload keeps its newlines instead of being cut on the wire with
  # its tail executed as a psmux command (psmux #560). `rename-window` is the
  # observable, harmless injection canary, exactly as in that report.

  # never reached the pane and hyphens could not be typed on Windows (issue
  # #920). talos escapes such a run into psmux's own `0xNN` codepoint form
  # (`control_mode::psmux_literal_args`). The psmux CLI forwards both encodings
  # to the same server-side classifier talos's control-mode line hits, so
  # typing them into one prompt line is evidence about that rule: the old
  # encoding must lose its hyphen, the new one must keep it.
