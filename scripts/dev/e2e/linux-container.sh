# e2e: talos's remote-SSH backend against a throwaway Podman container running
# sshd + tmux + git — the ephemeral-Linux member of the e2e family (see
# scripts/dev/README.md). Nothing touches your real ~/.ssh or ~/.config; all
# state lives under target/remote-ssh-test/ (gitignored) plus an isolated XDG
# home in a temp dir for the automated run.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev/e2e/linux-container.sh up        # build image + start container
#   scripts/dev/e2e/linux-container.sh test      # isolated headless e2e (asserts ssh:podman)
#   scripts/dev/e2e/linux-container.sh hosts     # print the hosts.toml block for manual TUI testing
#   scripts/dev/e2e/linux-container.sh ssh       # open a shell on the container
#   scripts/dev/e2e/linux-container.sh down      # remove the container
#   scripts/dev/e2e/linux-container.sh clean     # remove container + all local state
#
# Env overrides: TALOS_SSH_TEST_PORT (default 2222),
#                TALOS_SSH_TEST_DIR  (default <repo>/target/remote-ssh-test)
#
# Requires: podman, ssh-keygen, cargo. (No python3 — JSON is parsed in-shell.)
