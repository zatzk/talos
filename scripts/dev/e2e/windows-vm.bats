# Drives windows-vm.sh's psmux hook-status gate probes — the half of that
# harness that can be checked without a Windows VM, and the half issue #1170
# was about. Probe A asserted the pane-user-option round-trip and reported on
# its own `ok` branch whether or not the option came back, so nothing failed
# when psmux silently dropped it. These tests pin the two directions in which
# the probes must now fail, and that a failure reaches the exit status.

# Run one of the harness's helpers without provisioning a VM: windows-vm.sh
# dispatches a subcommand only when executed, so sourcing it hands back the
# helpers alone. What the helper printed is `${lines[0]}`; the last line is
# always `rc=<status> FAILS=<count>` — the exit status and the counter `bad`
# bumps, which is what the suite's verdict reads. Both are matched whole: the
# words at stake share substrings ("unknown" contains "no", "FAILS" contains
# "FAIL"), so a loose glob here would report safety these tests do not have.
