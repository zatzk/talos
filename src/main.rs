//! The kernel owns no pane. It resolves rects, calls plugins, paints what they

//! Every surface you see — the session list included — is a file under `ui/`
//! that you can edit while this is running.
//!
//! This file holds the loop's state — `App`, whose every field is documented
//! with what broke without it — plus the loop's constants. Startup lives in

//! and `App`'s behaviour in the rest of [`coordinator`], split by what each
