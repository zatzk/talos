//! Two halves. The first launches a command through the host's transport (ssh

//! PowerShell as UTF-16LE base64, because ssh space-joins its args for a default
//! sshd shell that is commonly PowerShell and would expand `$…` inside them.
//!
//! The second is about *error text*, and it is the half that is easy to skip and
//! then rediscover: OpenSSH ≥ 10 prints a three-line post-quantum advisory on
//! stderr, first, so it used to be the whole reported error; and PowerShell
