//! Every `git` invocation talos makes, local or on a remote host.

//! Split by concern — `command` builds the process (and scrubs the inherited
//! `GIT_*` that would silently retarget it), `plugin` clones a plugin's working
//! copy, `remote` runs commands over ssh/`wsl.exe` and decodes what came back,
//! `discovery` answers "what is here", `newrepo` makes a directory for a
//! repository that does not exist yet, `diff` produces diffs and stats, and
//! `worktree` creates, syncs and removes the checkouts sessions live in.
//! `git::*` is one flat surface; no caller names a submodule.

// One flat `git::*` surface, as before: the split is by file, and no caller
// outside this module names a submodule.
//
// A glob re-export clamps each item to its own visibility rather than widening
// it, which is what makes one line per file enough: `pub` items stay the public
// API they were, and the `pub(super)` helpers a sibling needs ride the same
// glob without becoming anybody else's business. Naming them individually would
// have meant an import list per file, kept in step by hand.
// `command` has no `pub` items — its widest is `pub(crate)` — so this glob
// says so rather than claiming a public surface it does not have.
