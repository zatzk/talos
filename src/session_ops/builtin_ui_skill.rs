//! The built-in **ui-skill** extension: installs one agent skill, `talos-ui`,
//! into each coding CLI's *personal* skill directory, so an agent in **any**
//! session knows how to change talos's own interface.
//!
//! It exists because the interface is Lua in a config directory of the user's,
//! which an agent working in an unrelated repository has no reason to know
//! about. The workaround it replaces is attaching that directory to every
//! session as an extra repo, which puts it in front of the agent whether or not
//! the session is about the TUI; a skill loads only when the request is.
//!
//! Like [`super::builtin_hooks`] it ships **embedded** and is auto-activated,
//! for the same reason: a person who does not already know the interface is
//! editable will not go looking for the extension that says so. The generic
//! half is [`super::builtin`]; this module is the spec. Opt out with
//! `talos-cli extension deactivate ui-skill`.
//!
//! The payload is one `SKILL.md`, delivered by the manifest's
//! `[[external_files]]` to each CLI's skill dir behind a `requires_dir` guard,
//! so a CLI the user does not run is skipped rather than having a config tree
//! conjured for it.
