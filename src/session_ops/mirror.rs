//! Mirroring a shareable host's database into local rows.
//!
//! The host's `talos-cli session list --json` (and `--deleted`) is the
//! record; this module reconciles the local rows on that host's backend to it
//! — adopting what is new, updating what changed, deleting and restoring what
//! the host says was deleted and restored — and writes nothing when nothing
//! moved, so an idle mirror does not bump `data_version` for every peer. The
//! observer keeps what is its own: display order, the companion shell, and a
//! pane id the host does not report.
//!
//! One JSON shape serves both directions: [`session_to_json`] is what the CLI
//! prints and what `session register` reads back, so the mirror and the
//! adoption of a legacy row cannot disagree about a field.
