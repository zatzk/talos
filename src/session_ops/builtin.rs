//! **Built-in extensions** — the ones that ship embedded in the binary and are
//! auto-activated, rather than being fetched from a source on demand (ADR-20).
//!
//! There are two, and they exist for the same reason: what they wire up has to
//! be there before the user knows to ask for it. [`builtin_hooks`] gives every
//! session its status dot with zero setup; [`builtin_ui_skill`] gives whichever
//! coding CLI the user runs the knowledge of how to edit talos's own
//! interface, in every session rather than only the one they thought to attach
//! the interface directory to.
//!
//! Delivery reuses the ordinary extension machinery whole: the embedded assets
//! are materialized into a stable local dir, then [`install_extension`]
//! installs them from there — so install, self-heal and uninstall are the same
//! code paths a fetched extension takes, and a built-in is not a second
//! installer with its own bugs.
//!
//! Opt out of either with `talos-cli extension deactivate <name>`, which
//! records a flag ([`Database::set_builtin_extension_optout`]) so startup
//! self-heal won't resurrect it; `activate` (or `install`) clears it.
//!
//! [`builtin_hooks`]: super::builtin_hooks
//! [`builtin_ui_skill`]: super::builtin_ui_skill
