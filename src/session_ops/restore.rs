//! Bringing a deleted session back — the row, its worktrees, and its agent.
//!
//! Restoring is not one step, and treating it as one is what made v2's restore
//! useless: clearing `deleted_at` returns a row to the list, but its worktree
//! directory was removed with the delete and its tmux window died with it, so
//! what came back was a session that could never attach. v1 does all three
//! (`App::restore_deleted_session`); this is that, headless, so the interface and
//! the command line cannot disagree about what restoring means.
//!
//! What can and cannot be recovered is the whole subtlety. A soft delete leaves
//! the worktree on disk, so restoring is exact. A **force** delete removed the
//! directory — the branch survives, so committed work comes back and
//! uncommitted work does not. That is lossy, so it is refused unless the caller
//! says it knows.
