//! The one-time repair of rows a WSL loopback host recorded as remote.
//!
//! Schema v47 only marks the repair as owed. It has to: what to rewrite is
//! decided by the *registry* — which names a loopback entry can have written,
//! and which of those a host talos still serves claims — and `storage` may
//! not read `hosts.toml` or run `wsl.exe`. This is the layer
//! that sees both, so this is where the two halves meet: the plan from
//! [`crate::agent::host_config::wsl_repair_plan`], the SQL from
//! [`crate::storage::Database::apply_wsl_repair_plan`].
//!
//! Driven from **every** startup that opens the database — the TUI boot and
//! the `talos-cli` entrypoint — because the mark is written by any binary
//! that opens it, and a headless-driven install need never launch the
//! interface. Until it runs, a mislabelled row reads as remote: a reap sweep
//! refuses to kill windows it believes are on another machine, and leaks them.

use crate::storage::Database;

/// Perform the repair if it is owed, returning startup notices.
///
/// Runs at most once per database, and the mark is what guarantees it: read
/// first so an invocation with nothing to do pays a single query, and cleared
/// once a pass has an **answer**.
///
/// A withheld spelling is an answer, and the distinction matters because the
/// opposite reading looks reasonable. Rows under a name a live host claims are
/// permanently indistinguishable — that host's own remote rows and the local
/// rows an older release mislabelled look identical — so no later start can
/// classify them better than this one. Keeping the mark until the claim
/// disappears would not settle them; it would rewrite them once the evidence
/// was merely *gone*, relabelling a live sibling's sessions local, which is
/// the misassignment the withholding exists to prevent. So the pass applies
/// what it can and retires.
///
/// Only a question that could not be *asked* keeps the mark: an unreadable
/// `hosts.toml`, distros that could not be enumerated, a failed write. Those
/// are transient, and the answer is still out there. Best-effort throughout: a
/// database that cannot be repaired must still open.
