//! Whether a session name is free to take on a backend, and the claim that
//! stops two creators from both deciding that it is.
//!
//! The rule the CLI's `--on-existing` already applied to `session create` —
//! a name is a question about **one backend**, because a database mirroring a
//! shareable host (ADR-24) holds that host's rows beside its own and two
//! machines may legitimately each have a session called `build`. Self-heal
//! never asked it: `ensure_extension` looked the name up across every backend
//! and spawned if it was absent, so a namesake on another machine answered for
//! the local session while two local sessions of one name went unnoticed
//! (issue #1192).
//!
//! Three things can hold a name, and the first two are only visible to a
//! lookup that knows to ask:
//!
//! - a **live** session — [`live_namesakes`];
//! - a **soft-deleted** one whose undo window is still open
//!   ([`undoable_namesake`]): the delete can still be taken back, and a
//!   creation now is a pair the moment it is;
//! - another **creator**, mid-spawn ([`hold`]). A spawn runs for tens of
//!   seconds, so "look, then create" is not a claim at all.
