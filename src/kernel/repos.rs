//! What the creation flow needs to know, computed off the render path.
//!
//! Three reads, all of them parameterised by something only the flow knows —
//! which host, which directory, which repository — and none of them cheap: a
//! bookmark list is a query, a directory listing is a readdir or an ssh round
//! trip, and a branch list is a `git fetch` followed by two more git calls. So
//! this is the fifth worker-backed store, after terminals, commands, diffs and
//! metrics, and it follows [`crate::kernel::diff`]'s shape exactly: **requests
//! are keyed and idempotent, work happens on a thread, and the result is
//! published.**
//!
//! Requests reach here from the flow through `store`, which the loop reads. A
//! plugin cannot call something that waits, and a command is an at-most-once
//! *act* — neither fits "tell me what is in this directory, and ask again as I
//! type".
//!
//! Two consequences a plugin renders rather than hides:
//!
//! - "not listed yet" is a state of its own, distinct from "nothing there" — a
//!   slow host must not look like an empty directory;
//! - a result is cached under the request that asked for it, so a listing
//!   arriving for a step the user has left is inert rather than needing to be
//!   dropped (v1 needed a generation stamp for this) — and a settled listing is
//!   re-read after a few seconds, because a directory created later must not be
//!   invisible for the life of the process.
