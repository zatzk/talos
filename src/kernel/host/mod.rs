//! Owns the Lua VM, the plugins loaded into it, and the slots they compose into.
//!
//! A reload throws the whole VM away and builds a fresh one. If the new VM
//! fails to build, the previous one keeps running and the error is surfaced —
//! so a typo costs a red pane, never the session you were watching.
//!
//! Two isolation rules make this safe to work in, and both are spec
//! requirements rather than niceties:
//!
//! - A plugin whose `render` throws is replaced by an error panel **in its own
//!   rect**. Its neighbours keep drawing and keep their state.
//! - A plugin that never returns is *interrupted*. Luau would have donated
//!   this; on Lua 5.4 it is ours to build, so every call runs
//!   under an instruction-count hook and a memory ceiling.
//!
//! The VM is deliberately not `Send` — mlua's `send` feature stays off, which
//! makes "plugins never touch the render thread" a compile error.
