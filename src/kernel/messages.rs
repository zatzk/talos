//! What the message band says about a command that finished.
//!
//! Pure vocabulary, kept out of the loop for two reasons. It is the part worth
//! testing — which outcomes are announced and which are deliberately silent is a
//! judgement that can regress without anything failing to compile — and the loop
//! has no business holding a table of words.
//!
//! The rule the table encodes: **announce what the screen does not already
//! show.** A reorder moves the row you are looking at; a theme repaints; a
//! setting shows its new value. Announcing those trains the reader to ignore the
//! band, which is exactly what makes the messages that matter unreadable.

/// What a finished command says it did, or `None` to stay quiet.
///
/// Quiet is the right answer for anything whose result is *already on screen*:
/// a reorder moves the row you are looking at, a theme repaints, a setting shows
/// its new value. Announcing those is noise that trains the reader to ignore the
/// band — which is what makes the messages that matter unreadable.
///
/// Everything else changed something invisible (a worktree rebased, an agent
/// relaunched, a row revived) and is worth a line.
