//! `text`, `box`, `input`, `surface`. Lists, gauges, dividers, tables and
//! titled panels are *not* here — they are composed in Lua from these four
//! (`ui/lib/widgets.lua`). That is the whole point: a prior
//! attempt froze a catalog at 6 kinds and watched it reach 16 without gaining
//! the ability to express code review, because every new appearance had
//! nowhere to live but a kernel enum variant. Adding a variant here costs a
//! release; adding a widget in Lua costs a file save.
//!
//! `kinds()` is the tripwire — `tests/kernel_node_catalog.rs` pins it at four.
//!
//! Lua never holds a ratatui object. A plugin returns a plain table, this
//! module translates it, and that indirection is exactly why throwing the VM
//! away on reload is safe.
