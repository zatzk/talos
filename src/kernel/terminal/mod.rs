//! Live agent terminals behind session-backed surfaces.
//!
//! This is the one place the kernel touches the session engine's *runtime*
//! rather than its stored state. A plugin places a `surface` naming a session;
//! this attaches to that session's real tmux pane, keeps a vt100 parser fed
//! from it, and paints the result with `tui_term` — the same path v1 uses in
//! `ui::terminal_view`.
//!
//! It reaches `crate::agent` through fully-qualified paths only, never `use`,
//! so every crossing into the side-effect layer is visible at its call site —
//! the rule `session_ops` and `cli` already follow.
//!
//! Three subsystems, one per file: the attach state machine here (plus the
//! shared [`Terminals`] state), plugin program panes in `programs`, and
//! link detection / selection reads / OSC 8 re-printing in [`links`].
//!
//! Two things are deliberately *not* here: spawning sessions and sending them
//! anything beyond keystrokes. Those are commands, and the command bus is a
//! later change. Attaching to what already exists needs none of it.
