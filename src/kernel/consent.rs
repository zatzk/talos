//! The one-time gate a v1 profile passes on its first v2 launch.
//!
//! v2 replaces v1 under the same binary name, which means auto-update moves
//! people to a different interface without their having asked — and `auto_update`
//! defaults to `true`, so most of them never read a release note first. Several
//! surfaces they may use every day are simply gone (see [`GONE`]).
//!
//! So the first launch on a profile that has v1 history stops and asks. It is a
//! plain-stdout screen rather than a modal, deliberately: it runs *before* the
//! interface takes the terminal, so it appears even if the interface would fail to
//! build, and it cannot be dismissed by a stray keystroke queued for a pane.
//!
//! Declining cannot load v1 — it is not in this binary any more. What it does is
//! turn `auto_update` **off** and print how to reinstall the 1.x line, because a
//! downgrade that leaves auto-update on would be undone on the next launch.
//!
//! That off-switch is the gate's to undo, and only its own: accepting v2 puts
//! `auto_update` back if — and only if — declining is what took it, which a
//! marker in `metadata` records. Without the marker the accept branch cannot
//! act at all, since a `false` in `settings.toml` reads the same whether the
//! gate wrote it or the user did.
//!
//! Which makes this forward-looking only, and deliberately so: a profile that
//! declined and then accepted *before* the marker existed carries an
//! indistinguishable `false`, and is left alone rather than guessed at. Turning
//! it back on there is a one-line edit the user makes.
