//! The plugin kernel: a session engine with a Lua-driven renderer.
//!
//! The kernel owns no pane. It owns a *vocabulary* ([`node`], four primitives),
//! the arithmetic that resolves where things go ([`layout`]), a read-only view
//! of the session engine ([`snapshot`]), and the VM that plugins run in
//! ([`host`]). Everything a user sees — the session list included — is Lua.
