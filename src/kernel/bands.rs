//! The chrome bands: what the application says about itself.
//!
//! Three single-row surfaces — who is running (`identity`), what just happened
//! (`message`), and what can be pressed (`action`). They are the non-modal half
//! of the rule `kernel::modals` states for the modal half: **system chrome is
//! kernel-owned, and plugins contribute data to it**.
//!
//! Two properties follow from that, and both are the point:
//!
//! * **Drawing a band runs no Lua.** Contributions are collected once, at load
//!   and reload, and every value that changes while running is read from state
//!   the kernel already holds. A plugin that throws, hangs or fails to load
//!   costs its own pane and its own entries — never the chrome.
//! * **The arrangement decides placement, the kernel decides contents.** A band
//!   is named as a slot in `ui/layout.lua` exactly as a pane's region is, so the
//!   bars stay movable in the file whose whole purpose is deciding what the
//!   screen looks like. A band the arrangement omits simply does not draw.
