//! The write side: commands a plugin issues, executed off the render path.
//!
//! The other half of "Lua never blocks". A plugin **cannot** wait for
//! anything, so a state-changing operation is not a function that returns a
//! result — it is a command that is accepted immediately and whose effect
//! appears in a later snapshot. That removes a whole class of stall (SQLite
//! contention, a git shell-out, an unreachable SSH host) for plugins nobody
//! has written yet.
//!
//! Three consequences the spec requires and this implements:
//!
//! - issuing a command returns at once, always;
//! - work in flight is *readable*, so a plugin can draw it rather than leaving
//!   an unexplained gap (v1 needed `PendingSpawn` for exactly this);
//! - a failure surfaces through a later snapshot, not as an immediate error.
//!
//! Each command runs on its own thread with its own database connection. That
//! is deliberate: a slow delete on an unreachable host must not queue behind
//! anything, nor hold a connection the UI thread wants.
