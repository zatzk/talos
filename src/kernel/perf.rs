//! Wall-clock-free counters for the render loop.
//!
//! v1 learned to assert on counters rather than timings: a test that says
//! "idle should be fast" is flaky on shared hardware, while one that says "an
//! idle loop painted no frames" is exact. These are the v2 equivalents of
//! `MetricsState::perf`, and they exist so the demand-driven redraw is
//! provable rather than hoped for.
//!
//! On top of them sits the **observability layer** of ADR-P11: fixed-bucket
//! duration histograms, a ring of named slow operations, and the startup phase
//! breakdown. Those are wall-clock, so they are display and logging only and
//! are never CI-asserted — the counters above remain the sole regression gate.
//! They are populated only while timing is active (`TALOS_PERF_LOG` or an
//! open perf HUD), so a default run pays one cached bool per iteration.
//!
//! The **per-plugin** half (ADR-P23) answers which pane spent the time:
//! [`PluginTable`] is recorded by the Lua host under the same gate, and
//! [`plugin_report`] turns it into the one ranked, hinted [`PluginReport`] the
//! HUD, the snapshot and `talos-cli perf --plugins` all read.
