//! The clipboard chords, declared rather than matched.
//!
//! Copy and paste used to be literal `KeyCode::Char('c')`/`('v')` arms in the
//! loop, ahead of the registry — which meant help listed them under *Fixed (not
//! rebindable)* and nobody could move them. They are ordinary bindings now,
//! owned by [`super::modals::OWNER`] like the modal chords: listed in help,
//! offered by the palette, conflict-checked, and rebindable. The loop still
//! *runs* them itself, because there is no Lua plugin behind them.
//!
//! **macOS gets `Cmd` as well.** `Ctrl+C` on a terminal means interrupt, so a
//! Mac user reaches for `Cmd+C` — and it did nothing, because the Command key
//! was dropped at the input boundary before any chord was resolved (issue
//! #1024). The modifier is carried through now ([`super::host::KeyPress::cmd`]),
//! and macOS builds declare the `Cmd` pair beside the `Ctrl` one — the same
//! "Cmd mirrors the Ctrl primary" pattern v1 used for its four Cmd alternates.
//! Arriving at all still needs the kitty keyboard protocol, which is pushed at
//! startup: iTerm2 3.5+, kitty, WezTerm and Ghostty report `Cmd`, Terminal.app
//! does not — and the emulator gets the chord first, so one that swallows its
//! own unperformed `Cmd+C` keeps it from talos whatever is declared here
//! (`docs/FEATURES.md` → Text Selection and Copy-Paste).
