//! The settings modal: every setting any plugin declared.
//!
//! Like help, it renders the registry rather than a list it maintains, grouped
//! by the plugin that declared each row — so a plugin gets a settings row by
//! declaring one table field and never learns how the row is drawn.
//!
//! Values stay a knob rather than a document: `Bool`, `Number`,
//! `Text`, and nothing else. A plugin wanting structured configuration reads a
//! file through its own capability.
//!
//! Unlike v1 — whose panel edits a draft and applies on `Ctrl+S`, because its
//! knobs write `settings.toml` and some need a restart — a write here goes
//! straight through `Registry::set_setting`, which is in-process and takes
//! effect on the next frame. So there is nothing to save and no Cancel.
