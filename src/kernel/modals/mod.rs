//! System modals: help, settings and the theme picker.
//!
//! These three are not panes and not plugins. A pane shows
//! your work and belongs in the layout; these are **system chrome** — they are
//! about talos itself, they overlay, they are modal, and they are the same in
//! every install. Making them plugins bought no extensibility (nobody replaces
//! the help pane wholesale) while costing the layout, the focus ring, and a
//! contribution mechanism nobody could reach.
//!
//! So the kernel draws them, in Rust, above the arrangement and above plugin
//! floats — the same place the perf HUD and the error panel already draw. The
//! consequences are the reasons:
//!
//! - **Not in the layout.** No slot, so a modal can neither shrink a pane nor
//!   be shrunk by one.
//! - **Not in the focus ring.** `focusable()` never contains one, so `Tab`
//!   keeps its short ring.
//! - **Captures input.** While open, keys reach the modal and no plugin is
//!   offered them. `Esc` closes; the opening chord toggles.
//! - **One at a time.** Opening one closes another, so there is no z-order
//!   question because there is no stack.
//!
//! Modularity lives one level down: plugins contribute **data** —
//! `Registry::bindings` for help, `Registry::settings` for settings — and the
//! kernel renders it. The theme picker deliberately takes no contribution;
//! there is nothing a plugin could add to a list of palettes.
