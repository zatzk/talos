//! The interface, looking at itself — as system chrome rather than as a pane.
//!
//! Every file the interface is made of, where it came from (shipped / edited /
//! yours / installed) and whether it is actually on screen — with, for the
//! selected file, why and what changes it — and restore, remove, trust and
//! switch. Three things about those files are otherwise invisible from inside
//! talos: a pane whose slot `layout.lua` does not place is dropped in silence,
//! a file that fails to load leaves the **last good version** running (so the
//! screen looks right while the file on disk is not what is on it), and a
//! bundled file you deleted looks exactly like one that was never shipped.
//!
//! **Why this is not a plugin.** It used to be one, deliberately: a pane that
//! lists panes is an honest test of whether the plugin API is enough to build a
//! pane with. But it is a *recovery* tool, and a recovery tool that is itself a
//! plugin can be the thing that is broken — a bad edit to it takes away the view
//! you would use to undo the edit. That is the same argument that made help,
//! settings and the theme picker kernel-owned, and it outranks the API test:
//! the API is exercised by every other pane, and `examples/lua/plugin.lua` is
//! the thing an author copies.
//!
//! Being chrome also removes the reachability problem that made it useless in
//! practice. As a centre-slot pane it needed an opening chord of its own, and
//! its chord was `F11` — the one F-key terminals commonly claim for fullscreen.
//! A modal is reached the way every modal is reached.
