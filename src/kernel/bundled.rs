//! The default interface, compiled into the binary.
//!
//! With no pane in the kernel, a broken plugin directory means
//! no interface *at all* — a failure mode v1 could not have. The embedded
//! copies make a blank screen unreachable while keeping the shipped interface
//! readable and editable as ordinary files, which matters when extensibility is
//! the point.
//!
//! Four rules, in order:
//!
//! 1. a copy on disk wins, so your edits are what runs;
//! 2. an *unmodified* bundled file is updated on upgrade, so fixes arrive;
//! 3. a *modified* one is never overwritten — it is preserved and reported;
//! 4. a *deleted* one stays deleted, because deleting it is how you remove it.
//!
//! Telling those apart needs a record of what was last written, which is what
//! the manifest is for. (4) is the one that is not obvious: it is exactly the
//! case of a file we know we wrote and can no longer find, and without it the
//! interface would re-deliver itself on every start and no bundled pane could
//! ever be removed (v2-plugin-lifecycle design D1).
