//! The user's settings, and what happens when they change.
//!
//! `settings.toml` is one file with two kinds of value in it, and the difference
//! is a fact about the code rather than a preference:
//!
//! - **live** — read every frame, so editing one takes effect at once (whether a
//!   surface exists at all, whether deleting is soft);
//! - **restart-only** — consumed once, at startup, by something that cannot be
//!   un-done mid-run: the mouse capture escape the terminal was already sent, the
//!   notifier thread, the scrollback a parser was built with, the audit prune.
//!
//! v1 draws the same line (`Settings::restart_only_differs`) and this holds it:
//! the live half lives here and is replaced on reload, the restart-only half stays
//! as it was published at startup and is read through
//! [`crate::session::settings::global`]. Asking this for a restart-only value and
//! asking the global for a live one would both be wrong, so
//! [`Config::in_force`] is the one answer to "what is the user running with" —
//! and it is what gets published to plugins.
//!
//! The reason this module exists at all: `settings::global` is a write-once
//! `OnceLock` shared with `talos-cli` and v1. That is what makes those callers
//! safe, so it must not become mutable — a live setting needs somewhere else to
//! live.
