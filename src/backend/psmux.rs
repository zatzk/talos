//! The psmux adapter: psmux's answers to [`TmuxCompatible`].
//!
//! psmux is a native-Windows clone of tmux that speaks its command and
//! control-mode protocol — with the divergences measured against it (ADR-13)
//! and kept here: its keystrokes go as key-names and `-l` literals (compatible
//! with versions before `send-keys -H`), a paste through its own `send-paste`, a window's command and
//! environment as one PowerShell token, and its server option scope, version
//! floor and control-mode framing are its own. What it shares with tmux is
//! [`Server`]; nothing here is tmux's, and nothing in the shared code asks
//! whether a server is psmux.
//!
//! An adapter for a multiplexer, not for an OS: psmux is the default on a
//! Windows machine ([`Multiplexer::default_for`]), and drives a host of any
//! platform the same way.
