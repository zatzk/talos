//! The append-only session event log — what `talos-cli watch` streams.
//!
//! Every writer that changes what a watcher would report appends one row here
//! **in the same transaction as the change it describes**. That is the whole
//! point: the previous `watch` sampled the session table every 250 ms and
//! diffed it, so two transitions inside one sample collapsed into one — a
//! `working → blocked → working` around an auto-answered permission arrived as
//! nothing at all, and a driver never learned the permission had been asked.
//! A log written by the writer cannot lose a transition, whichever process
//! made it.
//!
//! The log is a stream, not a record: it is pruned on the same retention as
//! [`crate::storage::audit`] (`settings.toml` `audit_retention_days`), and a
//! consumer that wants history reads the audit log instead.
