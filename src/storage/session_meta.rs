//! Per-session key/value metadata — the driver's own scratch space.
//!
//! Whoever is driving talos has identity of its own to keep beside a session:
//! a task id, a lease, a correlation key. Without somewhere to put it, that
//! identity ends up encoded in the session *name*, which then has to be parsed,
//! kept unique and kept inside the name-length limit — a shape talos should
//! not force on anyone.
//!
//! Keys are namespaced by convention (`fm.*`, `gc.*`, `you.*`) so two drivers
//! against one database do not collide. Nothing here interprets a key or a
//! value: this table is storage, and that is the whole contract.
