//! Delivering events to the plugins that subscribed to them.
//!
//! One dispatch point per iteration, after the worker stores and the command
//! bus have published and before the paint — so a handler sees the iteration's
//! fresh state and its `state`/`store` writes land in the frame about to be
//! painted, with no extra frame. It is a `VecDeque::is_empty` check on every
//! iteration with nothing queued, which is what keeps the settle test true
//! (`frame-cost`): dispatch never marks the frame dirty itself. A handler that
//! writes state bumps the state version, and one that enqueues a command goes
//! through `dispatch_tracked` — both already mark it, exactly as a key handler's
//! writes do.
//!
//! The kernel's own events are derived here from the signals the loop already
//! has — the snapshot's version, the focus ring, the command bus — never raised
//! by the code that mutates them. See `kernel::events`.
