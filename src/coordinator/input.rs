//! Keys, and where each one goes.
//!
//! Every chord resolves through one registry (`kernel::registry`), and the order
//! here is the whole of the policy: a modal first (it captures), then the
//! kernel's reserved chords, then copy and paste, then an exclusive grab, then a
//! plugin's declared binding, then the focused plugin's raw `on_key` hook, and
//! only then the key goes to whatever surface the focused pane shows. A
//! plugin-scoped claim never outranks a global one — which is why search cannot
//! take `Ctrl+N` from new-session.
//!
//! Copy and paste sit that high because they must work from any pane, and low
//! enough to be *bindings* rather than literal key arms: they are declared
//! (`kernel::clipboard`), so help lists them and they can be moved — onto
//! `Cmd+C` on a Mac, which is the point of carrying the Command modifier at
//! all.
