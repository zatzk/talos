//! Talos CLI binary — scriptable access to the same state the TUI shows.
//! Session commands work headlessly; `ui` targets a running TUI instance.
//!
//! This entrypoint owns the parts of the AXI contract (`axi/1.0-2026-07`) that
//! are about the *process* rather than about any one command: a failure that
//! left nothing to print is a structured document on **stdout**, and the exit
//! code says which kind of failure it was — `0` success, `1` the command ran
//! and failed, `2` the invocation was wrong, `3` the session reference matched
//! more than one session. An agent reads one stream and one status; splitting
//! the answer across stdout and stderr costs it a retry to find out what
//! happened.
//!
//! The exit code is the *only* half of that contract a caller may invert. An
//! `error` key on stdout implies a non-zero exit; the converse does not hold,
//! because a command whose report *is* the answer (`session doctor`, `config
//! validate`) prints that report and asks for a non-zero exit anyway. Gate on
//! the document, not on `$?`.
//!
//! The other half of that promise is that stdout carries **exactly one**
//! document. A command that renders its report and then asks for a non-zero
//! exit (`session doctor` on a broken session, `config validate` on an invalid
//! file) comes back as [`cli::Outcome::Failed`]: the report is the answer, the
//! exit code carries the verdict, and the sentence explaining it goes to
//! stderr — appending a second document there would break `jq` and every other
//! single-document parser on exactly the commands an integrator scripts.
