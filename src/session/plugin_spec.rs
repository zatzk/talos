//! What the interface is made of — the spec, and the record of what it resolved
//! to.
//!
//! Two files in the interface directory, and the split between them is the same
//! one `.bundled.json` and `ui.json` already make: [`SPEC_FILE`] is **hand-edited
//! composition** and [`LOCK_FILE`] is a **machine-written record**. You read a
//! spec diff and you skim a lock diff; a merge conflict in the record must not
//! dirty the half a person maintains.
//!
//! ```toml
//! # ui/plugins.toml
//! [[plugin]]
//! src  = "atlas"                  # bare name, URL, or path
//! file = "plugins/75_atlas.lua"   # load order lives in the filename
//! pin  = "v0.3.1"                 # omit to take the newest at install time
//! ```
//!
//! TOML because `docs/CONFIG.md`'s own rule is that hand-edited registries are
//! TOML, and because a malformed edit becomes a parse error naming its line
//! rather than a nil three frames later. Pure data here in `session` — the
//! dependency sink — so the kernel (which classifies a file's origin and resolves
//! trust) and the CLI (which installs and converges) share one definition,
//! exactly as they do for [`crate::session::AgentDef`] and
//! [`crate::session::HostDef`]. Nothing here touches the filesystem.
