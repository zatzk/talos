//! The operating system a machine runs, as its own dimension: independent of
//! how talos reaches it (the route's place) and of which multiplexer serves
//! it (the route's multiplexer).
//!
//! It decides shell and path semantics — `sh -c` or PowerShell, `$HOME` or
//! `%USERPROFILE%`, whether `/bin/sh` exists to pin as a server's
//! `default-command`. What a multiplexer can do (close events, hex keys) is
//! that backend's own capability and is never read off a platform, nor a
//! platform off a multiplexer's name.
