//! Extension manifests — pure data describing the talos resources an opt-in
//! extension needs to function (a dedicated session, a tick automation, …).
//!
//! Extensions (see `extensions/<name>/`) are agent-agnostic add-ons built on
//! `talos-cli`; per ADR-20 they live as data + shell scripts, never embedded
//! in the binary. An extension ships an `extension.toml` manifest; its installer
//! copies it into the discovery dir (`~/.config/talos/extensions/<name>.toml`),
//! and talos core reads *any* manifest without knowing the extension by name.
//!
//! The manifest is the declarative contract behind `talos-cli extension
//! activate/deactivate` and the startup/tick self-heal: it names the
//! sessions/automations to (re)create idempotently. Kept here in `session` (the
//! dependency sink) so both `agent` (the loader) and `session_ops` (the
//! orchestration) can depend on the same type without crossing module-isolation
//! rules — exactly like [`crate::session::HostDef`].
