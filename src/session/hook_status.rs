//! What a session's hooks-driven state *is*, and what it is *worth* — the one
//! vocabulary ([`SessionState`]), the read-time rules that derive it, and the
//! age, coverage and pane agreement that say how much to trust it.
//!
//! It lives in `session` rather than in either consumer because both the
//! interface and `talos-cli` have to answer "what state is this session in",
//! and while they each derived it themselves they answered different words for
//! one row — an acknowledged turn was `idle` on screen and `done` on `session
//! get` for the rest of the session's life. `session` is the pure module both
//! may import (`tests/architecture_rules.rs`), so the rules live here and each
//! caller applies the folds whose inputs it can actually observe:
//! [`derive_state`] everywhere (its inputs are all stored columns),
//! [`with_output_quiescence`] and [`with_reachability`] only where there is a
//! live terminal to ask.
//!
//! [`crate::session::HOOK_STATES`] is the agent's half of that vocabulary, and
//! the rest of this module is the honesty around it. `hook_state` is latched:
//! it is whatever was written last, by an agent that may since have crashed,
//! been interrupted, or never have been wired to report at all. A consumer reading the bare word cannot tell
//! `idle` ("the agent says it is at rest") from `idle` ("this agent has no hook
//! coverage and never said anything"), nor `working` ("a turn is running") from
//! `working` ("a turn was running an hour ago and the agent is gone").
//!
//! Three additive answers, none of which overwrite the stored state:
//!
//! - **Age** — [`age_secs`]. A stamp plus a duration lets a consumer apply its
//!   own policy instead of trusting a bare word. Deliberately *not* a built-in
//!   timeout: a turn may legitimately run for an hour, and a guessed bound
//!   would report it finished. An interface has a better signal
//!   ([`with_output_quiescence`]) which needs a live pane and so cannot be
//!   asked headless.
//! - **Coverage** — [`coverage_for`]. Which states an agent's wiring *can*
//!   produce, from the built-in `hooks` extension's payloads. `aider` reports
//!   only `blocked`; a user's own agent reports nothing. Absence of `working`
//!   means one thing for `claude` and nothing at all for `aider`.
//! - **Corroboration** — [`classify_foreground`]. What actually holds the
//!   pane's tty, from the foreground process group. This is the only check that
//!   can contradict a latched state, and the only way to see an agent talos
//!   never launched.
//!
//! Pure data and decisions: no process is run here, no file is read, and
//! nothing overwrites the stored state — every rule is read-time. The
//! callers gather the facts (a backend's `pane_state`, the agent registry, the
//! hook columns) and ask this module what they mean.
