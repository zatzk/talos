//! Clipboard writes that survive SSH.
//!
//! Two transports, and by default both are used (see [`ClipboardProvider`] for
//! the config knob that forces one):
//!
//! 1. **Native** ([`arboard`]) — talks to the local display server. Verifiable:
//!    it reports real success or a real error. Unavailable the moment talos
//!    runs anywhere but the machine holding the clipboard.
//! 2. **OSC 52** — an escape sequence the *terminal emulator* interprets, so it
//!    reaches the clipboard of whoever is looking at the screen no matter how
//!    many SSH hops are in between. Fire-and-forget: a terminal that doesn't
//!    implement it discards the sequence, and we can never tell.
//!
//! ## Why `auto` writes BOTH, and still does not check for SSH
//!
//! Sniffing `$SSH_TTY` to pick a transport is a trap, and the ecosystem has
//! already walked out of it. Neovim shipped exactly that in 0.10 and **removed
//! it as a breaking change** in 0.11 (PR #31730); nothing modern branches on
//! SSH for a clipboard *write*. talos has an extra reason to distrust the
//! env: the tmux server daemonizes with the environment of its **first**
//! client, so panes routinely carry stale or missing `SSH_*`.
//!
//! What that reasoning got wrong here was the next step: "*trying* the local
//! clipboard answers the question directly". It answers it only where a native
//! clipboard is **absent when nobody is at the machine** — X11 and Wayland,
//! where a headless SSH session has no display and `arboard` fails, so the
//! fallback to OSC 52 ran and copy worked. Windows has no such property: the
//! clipboard of a session nobody is looking at accepts writes and reports
//! success. So a copy from a Windows host over SSH landed in that host's
//! clipboard, reported success, and never reached the person who pressed the
//! key.
//!
//! Hence `auto` writes to **both**: native for the local case (verifiable, and
//! what a clipboard manager sees), OSC 52 for whoever is actually looking at
//! the screen. No SSH check, no platform branch, no way for one transport's
//! success to hide the other's necessity — and either one succeeding is a
//! successful copy. `native` and `osc52` still force a single transport for
//! anyone who wants one.
//!
//! ## Why we don't probe for OSC 52 support either
//!
//! Terminfo `Ms` and the `XTGETTCAP` query both false-negative constantly (only
//! foot/kitty/WezTerm answer; iTerm2 supports OSC 52 but reports that it does
//! not), and the query itself can corrupt output on older terminals. A false
//! negative silently disables copy — strictly worse than emitting a sequence a
//! terminal harmlessly ignores.
//!
//! Reading the clipboard over OSC 52 is not attempted at all: terminals disable
//! it by default as an exfiltration risk, and probing for it is actively
//! harmful (a read that times out stalled Neovim for >10 s on Windows
//! Terminal). Paste over SSH is the terminal's own `Ctrl+Shift+V`, which
//! arrives as an ordinary bracketed paste.
