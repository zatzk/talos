//! `talos-cli watch` — session state as a stream, so nothing has to poll.
//!
//! Every consumer of talos outside its own process has had one way to learn
//! that something changed: ask again, on a timer. That is a poll loop in every
//! integration, each with its own interval, each wrong in one direction or the
//! other — too slow to react, or spending a query a second to react to nothing.
//!
//! The stream is the `session_events` log ([`crate::storage::session_events`]),
//! not a sampled diff of the session table. That distinction is the whole
//! command: a diff every 250 ms collapses any two transitions inside one
//! sample, so `working → blocked → working` around an auto-answered permission
//! arrived as *nothing at all* and the driver never learned the permission had
//! been asked. Each writer appends its own event in its own transaction, so the
//! stream is what happened rather than what a sample could still see.
//!
//! The wake-up is still the gate the interface's own sync worker uses: SQLite's
//! `PRAGMA data_version` changes when *another* connection commits, so a reader
//! sits on a cheap pragma and reads the log's tail only when there is a tail to
//! read (see [`crate::sync`]).
//!
//! Deliberately not the kernel's event bus. That would need an IPC channel out
//! of a running interface, and would then only work while one is running —
//! whereas everything a driver needs to be woken by is already in the database,
//! written by whoever made the change, interface or not. A richer transport can
//! replace what is behind this command later without the command itself
//! changing.
