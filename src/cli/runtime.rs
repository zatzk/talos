//! `talos-cli runtime` — the processes talos runs that are *not* sessions.
//!
//! One exists today: the automation heartbeat, which this machine's backend
//! (the registry's default) keeps running — `automation tick` on a loop, so
//! schedules fire with no interface attached. It
//! is created implicitly by anything that arms an automation, and until this
//! command it appeared in no listing and no teardown reclaimed it — a session
//! delete cannot, because it is not a session. Anything talos puts on a
//! multiplexer server should be visible and stoppable from the CLI; this is
//! that noun.
