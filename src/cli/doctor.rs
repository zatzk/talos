//! The companion to `session doctor`, and deliberately the same shape: that one
//! asks whether an existing session's status hooks are wired, this one asks
//! whether the binaries a session is made of are installed at all. Splitting
//! them rather than growing one command follows what they are asked about — one
//! takes a session id, the other cannot, because on a fresh machine there are
//! no sessions to name.
//!
//! It reads; it never installs. Each `fail`/`warn` carries the one thing to do,
//! and where the answer depends on a distribution it names the package and
//! links the project's own install page rather than guessing an invocation.
