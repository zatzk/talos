//! `talos-cli plugin` — the headless half of what `F11` shows.
//!
//! Writing a plugin needs three answers the interface only gives to a keyboard:
//! which directory is actually being read, what a valid plugin looks like, and
//! whether the one you just wrote will load. A session driving talos through a
//! pipe — increasingly, an agent — cannot press `F11`, so it guesses, and the
//! usual outcome is a file edited in a directory nothing reads.
//!
//! Each subcommand is the same question `F11` answers, asked from outside.
//!
//! `cli` reaches `crate::kernel` here and in `cli::config`, and only by
//! fully-qualified path (the rule `agent` already follows here): both drive the
//! *interface's* own files, which is kernel-owned. `check` in particular has to
//! load the real host, because the failures worth reporting are
//! declaration-shaped — a plugin with no `render`, a slot nothing places, a key
//! that clashes — and a syntax check passes all of them.
