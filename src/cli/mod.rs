//! Command-line interface dispatcher for the `talos-cli` binary.
//!
//! Output is human-readable in a terminal and TOON down a pipe, because what
//! is usually on the other end of that pipe is an agent. Force a format with
//! `--json` (compact), `--pretty` (indented JSON), `--toon`, or `--text`. See
//! [`output::Format`] for the precedence and [`toon`] for the format itself.
//!
//! The CLI is intentionally thin: it parses arguments, calls into
//! `storage::Database`, `session_ops`, or a session's backend through the
//! registry it is handed, and prints the result. It hosts no TUI or event loop;
//! `ui` sends bounded requests to a separately running interface.
//!
//! It is also an **AXI** (`axi/1.0-2026-07`, <https://axi.md>) — an interface
//! shaped for an agent rather than for a person at a keyboard. Four of that
//! spec's rules are structural and live here rather than in any one
//! subcommand: output is TOON down a pipe (principle 1), running the binary
//! with no subcommand prints live state instead of a usage dump
//! ([`home::run`], principle 8), every result can carry `help[N]:` next steps
//! ([`output::AgentView`], principle 9), and errors are structured on stdout
//! with the exit code saying which kind they are — [`EXIT_ERROR`],
//! [`EXIT_USAGE`], [`EXIT_AMBIGUOUS`] ([`error_output`], principle 6). The rest
//! are per-command and marked where they are met.
//!
//! One consequence of principle 6 is a rule the entrypoint enforces: **stdout
//! carries exactly one document per invocation**. A command that renders a
//! report and *then* asks for a non-zero exit (`session doctor`, `config
//! validate`) has already written it, so its failure comes back as
//! [`Outcome::Failed`] and the sentence explaining the exit goes to stderr —
//! see [`Outcome`].
//!
//! That is also why the exit code is only half a contract in one direction: an
//! `error` key on stdout implies a non-zero exit, but a non-zero exit does
//! **not** imply an `error` key. `session doctor` on a broken session exits 1
//! with its report — the report *is* the answer, and a caller that gates on
//! `$?` before parsing throws away every diagnosis it will ever ask for.
