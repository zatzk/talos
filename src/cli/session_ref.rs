//! Resolving the thing a user typed to the session they meant.
//!
//! Every session verb takes a reference, and until this module there were two
//! answers to what one *is*: `message send --to` accepted a name or a UUID,
//! while everything else accepted a UUID alone. A driver therefore had to keep
//! its own name-to-id map and refresh it, for no reason other than which
//! subcommand it was calling.
//!
//! One resolver, three spellings, in the order that cannot surprise:
//!
//! 1. a full UUID — unambiguous by construction, so it is tried first and an
//!    id that parses is never also looked up as a name;
//! 2. an exact name;
//! 3. a UUID prefix, for typing the first few characters of an id.
//!
//! **Ambiguity is an error, never a guess.** Names are not unique (talos does
//! not enforce it, and a mirrored host contributes rows that legitimately
//! collide), so a reference matching more than one session is refused with
//! every candidate named. Acting on whichever row sorted first is the one
//! behaviour that would make a driver corrupt the wrong session silently.
