//! Reversible, non-destructive **TOML** deep-merge — [`crate::agent::json_merge`]'s
//! sibling for a `[[config_merges]]` whose target is TOML rather than JSON.
//!
//! It exists because kimi (Kimi Code CLI) reads its hooks from one shared file,
//! `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, and offers no drop-in hooks directory: dropping a
//! managed file there would clobber the user's whole configuration, and the JSON
//! merge cannot read it.
//!
//! - [`merge`]: tables merge recursively; arrays (both `[[array of tables]]` and
//!   inline arrays) union by rendered equality — an entry the target already has
//!   is not appended twice. Idempotent, and a **type conflict with the user's
//!   value is left alone** (never overwritten).
//! - [`prune_owned`]: remove our entries — and only ours — by an **ownership
//!   marker carried in each entry's own comment**.
//!
//! # Why ownership is a comment and not a content match
//!
//! [`crate::agent::json_merge::prune_marked`] identifies our entries by finding
//! a marker *in the entry's content* (every shipped hook command contains
//! `talos-cli session signal`). That is the only thing JSON offers — it has no
//! comments, and an ownership *key* inside the entry is not available either:
//! kimi accepts exactly four keys per hook and refuses to load the entire config
//! file when it sees a fifth. But a content match cannot answer either half of
//! the question it is asked:
//!
//! - It cannot tell **our** entry from the user's. `extensions/hooks/README.md`
//!   tells a user with an uninstrumented agent to call `talos-cli session
//!   signal` from their own hook; a content match then deletes that hook on
//!   uninstall — destroying configuration we never wrote.
//! - It cannot recognise **our own previous entry** once its content changes. A
//!   payload that renames an event or edits a command leaves the old entry
//!   behind, so updates accumulate duplicates.
//!
//! TOML has one thing JSON does not: comment decor that `toml_edit` binds to the
//! entry and carries through a render/re-parse round trip. So an entry is ours
//! **iff its own comment says so**, which answers both halves — a user hook that
//! merely mentions the signal command is not ours, and an entry of ours whose
//! content has since changed still is. Callers pair [`prune_owned`] with
//! [`merge`] (prune, then merge) so an update replaces our entries rather than
//! stacking a second copy beside them.
//!
//! The marker's one failure mode is a third-party tool that strips comments
//! while rewriting the file: our entries stop being recognised, so the next
//! install appends a second copy instead of replacing. That degrades to a
//! duplicate signal — the same state written twice, which is idempotent — and is
//! deliberately preferred to a content rule that deletes the user's own hooks.
//!
//! The target is parsed with `toml_edit` rather than `toml`, so the user's
//! comments, key order and spacing survive a merge into a file they wrote by
//! hand. The consequence for a manifest author is that the *shape* has to match
//! — a target spelling kimi's hooks as an inline `hooks = [{…}]` array where the
//! payload ships `[[hooks]]` tables is a type conflict, so it is left untouched
//! and the agent goes unreported rather than having its config rewritten into
//! the other shape. An inline array also has no comment to own, which is the
//! second reason the payload ships `[[hooks]]` tables.
