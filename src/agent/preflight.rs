//! Whether the binaries a session needs are actually installed.
//!
//! talos deliberately starts with no multiplexer and no coding agent on the
//! machine (`docs/CONSTITUTION.md`) — browsing, reading and configuring must
//! work on a fresh box. The cost is that the check used to happen at the worst
//! possible moment: the user committed to creating a session and got a number
//! back (`tmux new-window exited exit status: 127`), which names neither the
//! binary, nor where talos looked, nor what to install.
//!
//! This module is the one answer to "is the thing that would run this actually
//! there?", asked in three places:
//!
//! - the create-session flow, so the answer arrives *before* the user commits
//!   ([`crate::kernel::snapshot`] publishes it; probed on a TTL, never per
//!   frame);
//! - the spawn error, so a failure names the binary, the directories searched
//!   and the fix ([`crate::backend::tmux`]);
//! - `talos-cli doctor`, so it can be asked directly.
//!
//! It never blocks anything. A `Missing` answer is a warning on the choice
//! being made, not a refusal: an agent `command` can be a shell function, an
//! alias or something installed a second later, and treating "not on `PATH`"
//! as fatal would turn an improvement into a new way to fail — the same rule
//! `crate::backend::tmux_compat::server::resolve_local_program` is written under.
