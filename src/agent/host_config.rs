pub const SEED_HOSTS_TOML: &str = r#"# Talos hosts  —  ~/.config/talos/hosts.toml
#
# Each [[hosts]] entry describes an off-local target talos can run agent
# sessions on: a remote machine over SSH, or a local WSL distro. A host named
# "<name>" registers a session backend ("ssh:<name>" or "wsl:<name>"), offered
# in the new-session host picker (TUI) and selectable with
# `talos-cli session create --host <name>`. The agent process, its tmux
# window, and any git worktrees all live on the host (or inside the distro);
# only the TUI runs locally.
#
# SSH hosts: talos shells out to the system `ssh` binary, so authentication,
# keys, and connection details all come from your ~/.ssh/config — talos never
# handles credentials itself. The remote host needs `tmux` >= 3.2 and `git`.
#
# WSL distros are AUTO-DISCOVERED (via `wsl.exe -l -q`) and appear in the host
# picker with NO config here — only add a [[hosts]] entry with kind = "wsl"
# when you want to override defaults (e.g. worktrees_dir). The distro needs
# `tmux` >= 3.2 and `git` installed inside it; worktrees live in the distro's
# own Linux filesystem (fast), not on /mnt/c.
#
# Running talos INSIDE a distro discovers its siblings, but never the distro
# itself: that one is this machine, and a session on it is a plain local
# session (no --host). An entry whose `distro` is that one is ignored with a
# startup warning. An entry merely *named* after it works as written, but it
# records its sessions under the very name an older talos mislabelled local
# sessions with, so talos warns and leaves every row under that name alone.
# Name a NEW entry after the distro it reaches and there is nothing to warn
# about; renaming an EXISTING one moves no row, and leaves its recorded
# sessions behind under a name no host registers.
#
# This file starts empty (every entry below is commented out): a fresh install
# registers zero SSH hosts (WSL distros still auto-discover) and otherwise
# behaves like a local-only setup. Uncomment and edit an entry to add one.
#
# Unknown keys are reported on startup (and fail `talos-cli config
# validate`) but don't break the load.
#
# Fields per [[hosts]] entry:
#
#   name           (string, required)
#       Short, unique identifier. Registers the backend as "ssh:<name>" /
#       "wsl:<name>" and is the value `--host` expects. Example: "devbox".
#       May not contain ':' — that separates it from the multiplexer in a
#       session's route — and an entry that does is ignored with a warning.
#
#   kind           (string, optional, default: "ssh")
#       Transport: "ssh" (a remote machine) or "wsl" (a local WSL distro).
#
#   destination    (string, required for kind = "ssh")
#       SSH target passed straight to `ssh`. Either "user@host" or a Host alias
#       defined in your ~/.ssh/config. Example: "me@devbox". Ignored for WSL.
#
#   distro         (string, optional; kind = "wsl" only)
#       WSL distro name (as `wsl.exe -l -q` reports it). Defaults to `name`.
#
#   ssh_opts       (array of strings, optional, default: []; ssh only)
#       Extra flags inserted before the destination, one token per array
#       element (e.g. "-p" then "2222"). talos does NOT expand `~`, so use
#       absolute paths for things like `-i <keyfile>`.
#
#   socket         (string, optional, default: "talos")
#       Host `tmux -L` socket name. Override only to avoid colliding with
#       another talos/tmux server on the same host.
#
#   session        (string, optional, default: "talos")
#       Host tmux session name that groups talos's windows.
#
#   worktrees_dir  (string, optional)
#       Absolute directory (on the host / inside the distro) under which git
#       worktrees are created. When unset, talos uses
#       $HOME/.local/share/talos/worktrees there ($HOME resolved on first use).
#
#   multiplexer    (string, optional, default: "tmux")
#       Multiplexer binary on the host. Set to "psmux" when an SSH host is a
#       Windows machine (psmux speaks the same control-mode wire protocol);
#       WSL distros use "tmux".
#
#   platform       (string, optional: "posix" or "windows"; ssh only)
#       The host's operating system, which decides its shell and paths
#       (PowerShell and %USERPROFILE% on Windows, sh and $HOME otherwise).
#       Independent of `multiplexer`. When unset, a host with
#       multiplexer = "psmux" is Windows and any other is POSIX, as before.
#       A WSL distro is always POSIX, whatever this says.
#
#   share_sessions (bool, optional, default: true)
#       The host's own talos database is the record of the sessions on it:
#       talos mirrors that database into this one (a session made on the
#       host, or by another talos reaching it, shows up here) and creates,
#       deletes, restarts and restores sessions there by running the host's
#       own `talos-cli` — which it provisions under
#       ~/.local/share/talos/bin/ on the host when the host has none
#       (a release archive of this talos's version, checksum-verified;
#       a dev build ships its own binary under talos-dev/bin/ instead).
#       Set to false to use the host exactly as before: worktrees and hooks
#       driven from here, nothing mirrored, nothing installed there.
#
#   path_prepend   (array of strings, optional, default: [])
#       Directories put first on the agent's PATH on the host. talos reads
#       the host's login-shell PATH once (`$SHELL -lc`, then `/bin/sh -lc`,
#       non-interactive, 5s timeout) and puts it ahead of the bare PATH that
#       ssh / `wsl.exe` hand a command, so `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin` and
#       the like are found. Use this for what a login shell cannot report (one
#       that needs a terminal, or hangs). Absolute or "~/"-rooted ("~" is the
#       host's $HOME); anything else is ignored. Example: ["~/.local/bin"].
