//! Self-update: download, verify, and replace the installed talos binaries.
//!
//! This is the auto-update feature (gated behind `[features] auto_update`, on
//! by default for 1.0 — see [`crate::session::settings::FeatureFlags`]). It
//! surfaces two ways, both calling [`perform_update`]:
//!
//! - **TUI** — a silent check on startup (`main::spawn_auto_update`), run on a
//!   background thread so a slow download never blocks the first frame. A newer
//!   release is downloaded + installed in place (atomic renames against the
//!   install dir — the running process is untouched); the new version applies on
//!   the next launch, and the result is surfaced as a status toast.
//! - **CLI** — `talos-cli update` does the same on demand (`--force` bypasses
//!   the up-to-date / dev-build guards).
//!
//! It reuses the version-check plumbing ([`fetch_latest_release`],
//! [`decide_update`], [`crosses_major`], [`current_version`]) so dev builds
//! (`0.0.0-dev`) never auto-update and **a new major is never installed
//! automatically** — 2.x replaced v1's whole interface, so crossing that line is
//! the user's decision, not a background download's. It installs what
//! `scripts/install.sh` installs — the same release artifacts, the same
//! target-triple mapping, the same digest verified before anything is replaced.
//! It does not reach for the same *tools*: downloads go through the
//! `curl`/`wget` helpers and the unpacker is shelled out to, but the checksum is
//! computed in process, so verification does not depend on what the local
//! machine has on `PATH` (the installer's `sha256sum`/`shasum` do not exist on
//! native Windows — issue #1182).
//!
//! **Windows.** This path used to refuse outright, which made a default-on
//! `auto_update` silently mean nothing there (issue #1172). Two things make
//! Windows different, and both are handled rather than refused:
//!
//! - the release artifact is the `.zip` `install.ps1` extracts, not a tarball,
//!   so `extractor_for` picks the unpacker from the archive's own extension;
//! - a rename cannot replace an executable a process is running from, so
//!   `commit_binary` swaps with Win32 `ReplaceFile` there instead, which can.
//!   Its doc comment is where the interrupted-swap guarantee is written down.
