# Clipboard transport for copy. `auto` writes to the local clipboard
# when one is reachable and otherwise emits an OSC 52 escape sequence, which

# SSH, including nested SSH, with no setup on either end. Force `native` if
# your terminal mangles OSC 52, `osc52` to always target the terminal you're
# looking at, or `none` to disable copy. Pasting never uses OSC 52 (terminals
# disable clipboard reads for security) — over SSH use your terminal's own
# paste, usually Ctrl+Shift+V.
#
# Releasing a mouse drag copies the selection (copy-on-select), so copying
# needs no key — the reliable copy on macOS, where the terminal may keep Cmd+C.
# While it is on, Ctrl+C is always the interrupt. Set it to false to make a drag
# only select and Ctrl+C copy the selection instead.
