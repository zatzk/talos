# Contributing to Talos

This guide covers setting up your environment, the conventions the project
follows, and how to get a change merged. Skimming [`README.md`](README.md),
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and the design docs under [`docs/`](docs/) first will
save you time.

Be respectful and constructive: assume good faith, keep discussions on the
technical merits, and help newcomers find their footing.

## Getting started

1. **Clone** the repository — push branches directly if you have write access,
   otherwise fork first and branch there.
2. **Create a branch** off `main` (`git switch -c feat/my-change`).
3. **Set up the toolchain** (below).
4. **Make your change**, with tests.
5. **Run the checks** locally (`just lint && just test`).
6. **Push** and open a pull request with a clear description.

## Development environment

The reproducible dev environment is a **Nix flake** pinning the Rust toolchain,
`tmux`, `shellcheck`, Node, the cargo tooling, `just` and the demo stack.

```bash
nix develop          # enter the shell
direnv allow         # ...or, with direnv, auto-enter on cd (see .envrc)
```

No Nix? `scripts/install-dev-tools.sh` installs the dev tools (including
`prek`). You will also need `tmux >= 3.2`, `shellcheck`, `bats`, Node + npm (for
the website linters), `git`, and the three Lua gates `just lint` runs (`selene`,
`stylua`, `lua-language-server`).

MSRV is Rust 1.75, Edition 2021. The full walkthrough — including the runtime
sandbox for trying talos in isolation — is in
[`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Everyday tasks (`just`)

`just` is the task entrypoint — run it with no arguments for the full list.

| Task | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `just build` | build the dev binaries (`talos` + `talos-cli`) |
| `just test` | `cargo nextest run --all` |
| `just lint` | fmt-check + clippy + cargo-deny + rumdl + shellcheck + selene, stylua and lua-language-server |
| `just fmt` | format Rust + website |
| `just arch` | architecture-rule + rustdoc checks |
| `just sandbox` | run talos in an isolated dev sandbox |

## Coding agents

Talos is agent-neutral, and so is the repo. [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the
canonical guidance doc shared by coding agents. Keep repository instructions
there so every agent reads the same source.

The skills are checked in under `.agents/skills/`: eleven per-subsystem
working references (`talos-testing`, `talos-kernel`, `talos-remote-hosts`,
… — `AGENTS.md` indexes them) plus `ui-review`. They carry the
detail that used to sit in `AGENTS.md`, so it stays an index and an agent loads
only the subject it is working on. `.agents/skills/` is the agent-neutral home —
the body of every skill lives there once, and each is exposed to a specific CLI
by a **relative symlink** from that CLI's own directory (`.claude/skills/<name>`
→ `../../.agents/skills/<name>` today). A new skill is authored in
`.agents/skills/` and symlinked, never the other way round. opencode
auto-discovers `.claude/skills/`, so those symlinks serve it too — don't mirror
anything under `.opencode/skills/`, which would double-register it.
[thurview](https://github.com/Thurbeen/thurview), the guided-review publisher,
is maintained in its own repository and is not vendored here. Slash
commands are the one kind opencode does **not** auto-discover, so a new one goes
in both `.claude/commands/` and `.opencode/commands/`, kept in sync by hand.
A minimal [`opencode.json`](opencode.json) declares the `$schema` for editor
validation.

### The publish gate

Reviewing and shipping a change is the job of the
[publish](https://github.com/LeTuR/publish) skill, which runs one pipeline:
rebase onto `main`, review the whole branch against this repository's own
rules, run the gate, commit what the review and the gate fixed, push, open the
pull request, then watch CI. It writes into the PR body an attestation naming
the commit every one of those steps ran against — a green pipeline on a commit
nobody will merge proves nothing, so a body whose attestation names anything
but the head is stale and says so.

Install it once per machine, then ask your agent to publish the branch:

```bash
npx skills@latest add https://github.com/LeTuR/publish --skill publish --agent claude-code --global --yes
```

[`.publish.yaml`](.publish.yaml) is everything the skill reads here: the base
branch, the two gate steps and the files the review must read. Its lint step
runs `just lint` plus the rustdoc check, so it needs the same dev toolchain the
manual workflow does. It does not run the website linters — those need
`npm ci`, and CI's `website-lint` job covers them. It is external tooling, so
it is described here rather than in [`docs/CONFIG.md`](docs/CONFIG.md), which
covers talos's own configuration.

The project's code-quality rubric is [`docs/REVIEW.md`](docs/REVIEW.md), which
`.publish.yaml` names in `review.rules`: the per-path house rules a reviewer
reading only the diff could not know, the trees that carry no reviewable
intent, and the documentation ownership map. There is no review command to run
by hand — extend those rules rather than reintroducing one. They live on your
branch and take effect there, so a change that weakens them is a change the
pull request shows.

Performance is reviewed there rather than measured there, deliberately. The
`src/**` block carries the render loop's change-signal rules — including that a
compare-before-store is not enough for anything recomputed per frame from a
source that moves continuously, which is the failure ADR-P20 records — and asks
a change claiming a performance effect to carry a paired before/after from
`just bench` or `just perf`. What the gate does *not* do is time anything: that
would be a flaky assertion about the machine it happened to run on, which
[`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) rules out in ADR-P5. The
deterministic half is ordinary test coverage — counters and change-signals in
`tests/kernel_perf.rs` and `tests/kernel_frame_cost.rs` — and the lint step
compiles `benches/` through `cargo clippy --all-targets`, so the instrument
cannot rot while nobody is running it.

The load harness stays out of the gate by refusing to run there
(`TALOS_GATE`). It lives under `scripts/dev/`, drives the real binary and
prints a result, so it reads as a test to anything deciding what "run the tests"
means — and a step that waits through a release build and timed runs fails on
the agent timeout, which is what happened once. That is also why the `test` step
names the suite explicitly rather than leaving the choice to whatever is driving
the gate.

The fixes the gate commits are ordinary conventional commits, so the
`commit-msg` hook — the one place a branch commit is still refused — accepts
them. `chore` is the type to reach for: it is scopeless (`cog.toml` enumerates
the valid scopes and a gate fix spans them) and omitted from the changelog, and
under squash merge no branch commit reaches the release decision anyway; the
pull request title does.

One discipline the gate cannot do for you, because it validates committed
history rather than your working tree: **stage deliberately**. Commit the files
that belong to the change and nothing else — never `git add -A` on a dirty tree
— and keep credentials, `.env` files, keys, large binaries and scratch files
out. Leave unrelated uncommitted work where you found it; a change carrying
someone else's work in progress is one the reviewer cannot tell apart from
yours.

## Testing

Talos follows **test-driven development** — write a failing test first, make
it pass, then refactor. Bug fixes start with a test that reproduces the bug.

```bash
cargo nextest run --all              # run all tests (preferred runner)
cargo nextest run -E 'test(name)'    # run a single test by name
```

The interface is Lua on a Rust kernel, so most coverage drives the **real kernel
over the real `ui/`**: `tests/kernel_mvp.rs` for the kernel's contract and
`tests/*.rs` one file per surface. Pane frames are pinned as literals in
`tests/frames.rs` — when a frame changes on purpose, the failing test prints
the new one to paste; there are no snapshot files and no tool to run. Crash
invariants are properties in `tests/render_props.rs`, and `tests/tui_e2e.rs`
drives the real binary on a real pty (`just smoke`). All of it runs in the one
`cargo nextest run --all`; see the `talos-testing` skill under
`.agents/skills/`.

## Linting and formatting

CI runs a zero-warning policy — `clippy` and `rustdoc` warnings are errors.

```bash
cargo fmt --all                                            # format (100-char width)
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings   # lint
rumdl check .                                              # markdown lint
npm run lint:website                                       # website linters
```

`just lint` bundles the Rust + shell checks.

## Pre-commit hooks

[`prek`](https://github.com/j178/prek) runs the same checks CI does before each
commit. Install the hooks once after cloning:

```bash
prek install
```

- **commit-msg** — conventional-commit validation (`cog verify`)
- **pre-commit** — fmt, clippy, check, nextest, architecture rules, cargo-deny,
  rustdoc, bats, shellcheck, rumdl, prettier, htmlhint, stylelint, eslint

There is no **pre-push** stage. The hook that used it walked the branch's own
commit messages, and squash merge discards those — see below.

## Commit conventions

All commits must follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), enforced locally
by `cocogitto` in the `commit-msg` hook. That hook keeps the branch's history
legible; it is not what gates the merge — the pull request title is, because
that is the only message that survives the squash.

- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`,
  `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`
- **Scopes:** `api`, `cli`, `ui`, `git`, `core`, `docs`, `deps`, `config`,
  `mcp`

```bash
cog commit feat "add remote host picker"
cog commit fix "avoid panic on empty worktree" git
```

Commit type drives releases: `feat` → minor bump, `fix` / `perf` → patch bump;
`docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `style` and `test` produce no release. On `main` the type
that counts is the **pull request title's** — see below.

### The pull request title is the commit

Pull requests land by **squash merge**, so the commit that reaches `main` is not
any commit from your branch: GitHub builds it from the pull request title plus
its own `(#N)` suffix.

There is no merge queue: at this repository's merge cadence it batched nothing
and merged one pull request at a time behind a second full CI run. Reintroducing
one would need a `merge_group:` trigger back in `ci.yml` — without it the
required `All Checks` gate never reports on a queued pull request and the queue
stalls until its own check timeout.

```text
fix(core): keep the caret where the frame put it
  ↓ squash merge
fix(core): keep the caret where the frame put it (#1044)
```

That single string is what `cog bump --auto` reads for the release decision and
what the changelog quotes. Nothing else validates it: CI no longer walks the
branch's commits, because squash discards exactly those. So the type and scope
allowlists apply to the **title**, and it is the title's type that decides the
release — a branch whose every commit is `fix`
still ships nothing if its pull request is titled `docs:`. Keep a pull request
to one purpose and title it after its most significant change.

Declare a breaking change in the title (`feat(core)!: …`) or as a
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the pull request **body**. The squash commit's body
comes from the body box, so a footer left behind in a branch commit is
discarded.

[`scripts/ci/check-pr-title.sh`](scripts/ci/check-pr-title.sh) enforces this as
the required `PR Title` check. It validates the title in the exact form that
lands, suffix included, and rejects one that already ends in a `(#N)` of its own
— squash would append a second. When it rejects a title it prints the types and
scopes `cog.toml` declares, so the message is enough to correct it. It runs from
its own workflow rather than from CI because `ci.yml` does not listen for
`edited`, so a title changed after checks went green would otherwise never be
revalidated; its bats suite runs in CI's `PR Title Checker` job so that workflow
stays lean.

## Documentation

If a change invalidates or extends a documented decision, update the relevant
doc in the **same PR**. Rationale lives in:

- [`docs/CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/CONSTITUTION.md) — non-negotiable principles
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — architectural decisions
- [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md) — feature-level design choices
- [`docs/CONFIG.md`](docs/CONFIG.md) — talos's own config files, env vars and
  DB settings
- [`docs/REVIEW.md`](docs/REVIEW.md) — the house rules a change is reviewed
  against, and which document owns which class of fact

Comments explain **why**, not **what** — see the Comments section of
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Architecture

Module dependencies are one-directional (`session ← agent ← kernel ← main`) and
enforced by `tests/architecture_rules.rs`: a new module fails that test until
its dependencies are declared in the allowlist. The graph is documented in the
Module Dependency Rules section of [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and, with the full
per-module allowlist, in [`docs/CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/CONSTITUTION.md).

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR.
- Include tests for new behaviour and bug fixes.
- Make sure `just lint` and `just test` pass locally.
- Say **what** changed and **why**.
- Update docs alongside code when a documented decision changes.

CI runs the same deterministic checks (clippy, nextest, cargo-deny, `cog`,
rumdl, shellcheck) that gate every merge — there are no LLM-gated checks.
