-- Bring a session forward the moment it needs you.
--
-- The first example that REACTS rather than draws. It occupies no slot and
-- paints nothing; it subscribes to two events — `session.status`, to notice a
-- session going `blocked`, and `focus.session`, to notice you moving — and when
-- a session blocks while you have not moved the selection for a few seconds,
-- that session becomes the selected one, exactly as `talos-cli session focus`
-- would select it.
--
-- Two things worth copying. It never steals focus from a person: a selection
-- moved less than `GRACE_MS` ago is a person's, and the event is let go. And it
-- can be switched off without a reload — a palette command (`Ctrl+P`, then
-- "attend") flips the declared setting, which the settings modal then shows
-- correctly, because the value has exactly one home.
--
-- To use it, copy it into your interface directory (`talos-cli plugin dir`).
-- It needs no trust: it reads the snapshot and issues commands, like every
-- other plugin. `talos-cli plugin events` lists what else it could listen for.
