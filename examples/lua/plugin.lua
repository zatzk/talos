-- declare what you are, return what to draw, handle what you declared.

  -- and it is what `focus:` roles and the settings modal group by.

  -- Where you draw. `center` shares the middle with the agent (one visible at a
  -- time); `sessions` is the left column. A slot `ui/layout.lua` does not place
  -- is never drawn — which is how a float declares that it takes no room.
