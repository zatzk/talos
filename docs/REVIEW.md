# Reviewing a change

The house rules a change to this repository is reviewed against — what a
reviewer reading only the diff could not know. Most of them are the encoded
result of a mistake this project already made, and the rule carries the defect
that produced it, because a rule without its reason is the first one somebody
deletes.

These rules were a gate tool's configuration until they moved here; they were
never tool-specific. [`.publish.yaml`](../.publish.yaml) names this file in
`review.rules`, so whatever runs the review reads it before the first round,
and a human reviewing by hand reads the same file.

**Read the block for every path the change touches, and only those.** The rules
are scoped: a docs-only change is not held to the `src/**` block, a change
spanning `src/` and `ui/` is held to both, and reading a block that does not
apply is how a review produces findings nobody asked for.

## Paths that carry no reviewable intent

Generated or vendored trees. `*` never crosses a `/`, and a pattern with no
slash matches by basename at any depth.

- `Cargo.lock`
- `package-lock.json`
- `proptest-regressions/**`
- `media/**` — demo GIFs/MP4s and tutorial stills, produced by
  `scripts/demo/record*.sh`.
- `website/assets/tutorial/**`, `website/assets/ui-review/**`, `*-poster.webp`
  — only the unreviewable part of `website/assets`: the tutorial stills that
  `scripts/demo/record-tutorial.sh` copies from `media/tutorial/`, the
  `ui-review` skill's captures, and the committed poster frames, which are
  rasters carrying no reviewable diff (only the doom and hero ones have a
  producer in the tree, `record-doom.sh` and `record-hero.sh`; the rest were
  committed by hand). Everything else there — `favicon.svg`,
  `logo*.svg`, `og-image.*`, the fonts — is hand-authored source and stays under
  review; an SVG is text and can carry a script element or an external
  reference.

## House rules by path

### `src/**`

Module boundaries are enforced by tests/architecture_rules.rs as an allowlist
over resolved edges: session is pure data, agent may reference neither git nor
backend, and kernel reaches agent, the backend contract or usage by
fully-qualified path only, never a use - a function-local use or an alias
included, since a reference counts where it resolves. Consumers name the
backend contract; only backend::wiring names an adapter, and only a
composition root names backend::wiring. A new module fails that test until its
rules entry is declared, and every entry, coordinator's too, is asserted by one
loop. A crossing that is still allowed is in its TRANSITIONAL table with the
task that removes it; adding one is a design decision, not a fix.

Anything that touches the world - terminal attach, commands, diffs, metrics,
git, repository reads, update checks - runs on a worker and publishes back,
never on the render loop, because a down remote host runs its ssh out to the
connect timeout.

A cache here carries an age, not just a value: a TTL, an in-flight marker, or a
generation counter. Storing "we have an answer" where "the answer is current"
was needed is the mistake this code base has made repeatedly. A change-signal
is bumped inside the mutation and only when the value actually changed.

The render loop's cost is gated on those signals, so read a change to anything
on the per-frame path - the loop body, republish, the snapshot, the published
groups, the terminal stores - for what it does to them, in both directions. A
signal that stops moving when its source did is a stale pane with no error
anywhere. A signal that moves when nothing a reader cares about did is silent
waste: it rebuilds every published group and drops every pure pane's cached
tree, and the frame still looks correct. Agent output in particular must never
move the data epoch - that is what lets a streaming turn reuse diffs, links,
content, commands and metrics whole.

A signal is also worth scoping to whoever reads it. The animation clock
invalidated every pure pane eight times a second for a spinner one of them
draws, until `ctx.elapsed` became something the kernel could see a pane ask for
(ADR-P21). Prefer observing a dependency over asking a plugin to declare one: a
declaration that defaults to "no dependency" fails silently for whoever did not
read the release note, and one that defaults to "yes" saves nothing.

"Only when the value actually changed" is necessary and not sufficient, and
ADR-P20 is the case that proves it: the link scan compared before storing, and
the answer had genuinely changed, because a scrolling screen puts its URLs on
new rows every frame. Compare-before-store asks whether the value moved; the
second question, for anything recomputed on the frame path from a source that
moves continuously, is whether it was worth asking yet - a pacing interval or a
stamp, sized to what a reader can act on. Ask that of any new per-frame
recompute.

A change that claims a performance effect carries its measurement: `cargo bench
--bench frame_cost` for the pieces of a frame, or `scripts/dev/perf-run.sh` for
the whole binary under load, reported as a paired before/after at a stated
terminal size and session count. An absolute number on its own says nothing -
the harness and the bench both pin their inputs for that reason. Timing
assertions stay out of the test suite (ADR-P5); the deterministic half is
asserted on counters and change-signals instead, in tests/kernel_frame_cost.rs
and tests/kernel_perf.rs.

A newly published talos.* field also goes into talos.yml at the repo root:
it is selene's standard library for the Lua tree, so a field LuaHost::publish
adds but it does not declare is a lint error in every plugin that uses it. The
change originates here, in a diff that need not touch ui/ at all.

This repository is test-driven: a bug fix starts with a test that reproduces
the bug, so it fails before the fix and passes after it. That test goes
wherever this repository already puts one, and both places are ordinary: a
module's own `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block, which most files under src/ carry
and which is where a fix to one module's logic usually belongs, or a file under
tests/ when the coverage crosses modules or drives the kernel, the interface or
the binary end to end. A src-only fix whose regression sits inline is the
normal shape here, not a missing test; what is missing is a fix that adds
neither.

Comments explain why, never what. A stale comment is worse than none, so
comments around touched code are fixed or deleted. This repository uses no
TODO, FIXME or HACK markers and keeps no commented-out code.

Read the change for structure as well as correctness: names that reveal intent,
functions that do one thing, duplication folded together, dead code and unused
imports gone, magic values named, early returns rather than deep nesting, and
no abstraction introduced before there is real duplication to justify it.

Read it for coherence too, across the whole diff and against the code around
it: naming, patterns and abstractions consistent with the rest of the tree,
signatures, return types, error handling and data shapes agreeing between
callers and callees, and no contradictory conditions, redundant branches or
unreachable code left behind.

### `ui/**`

This is the Lua interface running on the Rust kernel, and the plugin sandbox is
enforced by absence: os, io, debug, package, print and the loaders are not in
the environment. talos.yml is selene's standard library for this tree and
must stay in step with LuaHost::publish, so a newly published talos field is
added there too.

There are four node kinds - text, box, input, surface - and everything else
composes in ui/lib/widgets.lua; do not propose a fifth. Panes declare size
statically, read from the snapshot and write by command, and never block. Ask
for a theme role rather than a colour, so one pane looks right under all
thirty-six palettes.

Read the change for structure as well as correctness, the same way a Rust one
is read: names that reveal intent, functions that do one thing, duplication
folded into ui/lib/ rather than repeated across panes, dead code and unused
locals gone, magic numbers named, early returns rather than deep nesting, and
no abstraction introduced before there is real duplication to justify it.

ui/lib/ is a public API. Edited layouts and panes are preserved across upgrades,
and third-party panes call into lib/ too, so a change there keeps the promise in
ui/AGENTS.md: an exported name is never removed, renamed or given another kind.
A call that worked keeps working, and a retired name stays as a shim.
tests/edited_interface.rs checks this. A change that edits its frozen fixtures or
drops a line from lib_surface.txt is breaking that promise, not tidying.

Read it for coherence too, across the whole diff and against the panes around
it: naming, patterns and widget use consistent with the rest of ui/, the shape
a helper returns agreeing with what every caller expects, snapshot fields read
as they are published, and no contradictory conditions, redundant branches or
unreachable code left behind.

### `examples/panes/**`

Example panes that install by bare name. The same plugin sandbox as ui/
applies: no os, io, debug, package or print, four node kinds only,
snapshot-read and command-write, and theme roles rather than colours. These are
examples to read and copy from, not a catalogue talos maintains for anyone.

Hold them to the same structure and coherence rubric as ui/, and more strictly
for being examples: intention-revealing names, one thing per function, no
duplication or dead code, magic numbers named, early returns over deep nesting,
no abstraction ahead of real duplication, and patterns consistent with the
panes under ui/ - somebody will copy whatever shape this file teaches.

### `benches/**`

The frame-cost instrument, not a test: `harness = false`, run by `cargo bench`,
deliberately outside the PR gate per ADR-P5, which keeps wall-clock timing out
of CI. `cargo clippy --all-targets` still compiles it under `just lint`, so it
cannot rot silently.

Judge it on one question: does it measure what the loop actually does? A bench
that measures something no frame performs is worse than none, because it is
believed. The trap already paid for here is rendering every loaded plugin
rather than the panes an arrangement of that size places - a closed search
strip occupies no slot, `draw_slots` never reaches it, and the bench reported
it as the second most expensive pane in the interface. So a phase must
correspond to a step the loop takes, and every input a number depends on - the
palette, the session count, the terminal size, the epoch - is pinned or swept
explicitly, never inherited from the developer's environment.

Subtracting one measurement from another to isolate a phase is only honest when
the subtrahend is small, and the invalidator that makes the subtrahend small
must still invalidate everything being measured. Per-pane cost is driven by
`cold()` — the themes epoch — which is in the pure-pane cache key
unconditionally while gating only the palette, so every pane really re-renders
and the publish beside it stays a near-cache-hit. Not a snapshot change, where
the publish is a ~1ms rebuild and the subtraction measures itself; and not the
animation epoch, which since ADR-P21 leaves a pure pane that never reads
`ctx.elapsed` served from its cache, so every such row would report roughly
zero.

### `scripts/dev/perf-run.sh`

Runs the real binary under load and reports CPU. Its failures are plausible
numbers rather than errors, so read it for the two it already guards: it must
identify its OWN process (a developer's running talos answers to `pgrep -x
talos` first, and every configuration then reports that instance's CPU), and
the TUI must start before any session exists, or the v1->v2 consent gate waits
for a keypress and the run reports 0%.

A reading is only comparable with another at the same terminal size and session
count, so both stay explicit parameters and neither acquires a default that
varies with the invoking window.

### `tests/**`

A test that shells out to git must scrub the GIT_* location variables
(git::GIT_LOCATION_ENV). Git exports them to hook processes, so a suite running
under this project's own pre-commit hook inherits a GIT_DIR pointing at the
real repository and will rewrite it.

A test that starts a tmux server must hold a TmuxServer guard
(tests/support/tmux_server.rs) rather than pin a socket and kill it by hand.
Teardown written at each exit point is skipped by every path that panics or
times out, and the server it leaves has lost its socket file with the run's own
directory, so nothing can connect to reap it. tests/tmux_server_leak.rs gates
this per pin site; do not propose a cleanup() call as the fix for a leak it
names.

tests/frames.rs pins bundled panes' frames cell for cell as literals on
purpose, against fully pinned inputs; that is an owned snapshot contract, not
an accident, and a failing test prints the new literal to paste. Do not propose
replacing it with a snapshot tool or loosening its inputs - a frame that moves
on its own is worse than no test.

This repository is test-driven: a bug fix starts with a test that reproduces
the bug, so it fails before the fix and passes after it. Coverage belongs in
the file that owns the surface - tests/kernel_mvp.rs for the kernel's contract,
one tests/<surface>.rs per interface surface or contract, tests/render_props.rs
for proptest crash invariants, tests/tui_e2e.rs for the real binary on a real
pty - rather than in a new file beside them. Follow the conventions already in
that file and cover the edge case as well as the happy path.

A test must execute a real interface and assert observable behavior, state,
output or failure mode. A test whose only evidence is that it greps
implementation source for a string, a name or a token proves nothing: the text
can be dead, and a behavior-preserving refactor changes it.

### `docs/**`

Documentation prose. Do not request test coverage for it. The worked Lua
examples that used to sit here now live under examples/lua/ and carry their own
block below.

### `examples/lua/**`

Worked example panes, not prose: selene and stylua cover them under `just
lint`, and examples/lua/plugin.lua is embedded in the binary as what
`talos-cli plugin new` writes, so a break here ships a starter that does not
load. Read them the more carefully for it - the Lua type check runs against ui/
only, so a type error here reaches neither linter. The same plugin sandbox as
ui/ applies: no os, io, debug, package or print, four node kinds only,
snapshot-read and command-write, and theme roles rather than colours.

The structure and coherence rubric applies here as it does to ui/, and a worked
example carries it further than most code: intention-revealing names, one thing
per function, no duplication or dead code, magic numbers named, early returns
over deep nesting, and shapes consistent with the panes a reader will go on to
write.

### `website/**`

Website prose, styles and templates. Do not request test coverage. Only website
CSS and JS are Prettier-formatted (see .prettierignore).

### `scripts/**`

Every tracked *.sh is linted by shellcheck under .shellcheckrc, which sets no
default shell: the dialect is derived per file from its own shebang, or from a
`# shellcheck shell=` directive in a library that is sourced rather than run.
Bash is the norm here - judge a script by the line at the top of it rather than
by a repo-wide default.

Not everything under this path is shell. scripts/demo/*.tape are VHS tapes
driving the real TUI, scripts/demo/trim-cast.mjs is Node, scripts/bench/ is
standard-library Python (the multiplexer benchmark, which needs a pty and
/proc, and must not grow a dependency to install), and the installers have
their own block.

### `scripts/install.*`

The two installers are a mirrored pair - install.sh for Linux/macOS,
install.ps1 for Windows - and each is fetched and piped straight into a shell,
so a break here is a break in the documented one-line install rather than
something a user can work around.

install.sh is deliberately POSIX sh, not bash: it is run as `curl ... | sh`.
Keep it to standard tools (curl/wget, tar, sha256sum/shasum), non-interactive,
and cleaning up through its trap.

install.ps1 is PowerShell 5.1+ and its source must stay ASCII-only, because
that is what survives `irm | iex` decoding on Windows PowerShell 5.1.
Write-Host for UI output is intentional and not a lint to fix - Write-Output
would leak into the iex pipeline - and the pure helpers are guarded by
$env:TALOS_PS_TEST so the file can be dot-sourced for testing without running
the installer.

Both are tested, and a change to either should move its suite: install.bats
(bats-core) covers install.sh and install.Tests.ps1 (Pester 5) is its
PowerShell mirror, each run by its own CI job.

## Documentation ownership

The placement policy: a duplicate is reduced to a pointer rather than
synchronized, and a change that invalidates a documented decision updates its
owner in the same change.

Each class of fact has exactly one owner document. docs/CONSTITUTION.md owns
core principles. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md owns architectural decisions and their
ADR-NN anchors. docs/PERFORMANCE.md owns render-loop and tick performance
decisions and their ADR-PNN anchors, and a performance ADR records the
measurement that produced it - the harness invocation, the terminal size, the
session count and a paired before/after - so the number can be reproduced
rather than remembered. docs/FEATURES.md owns feature-level design choices.
docs/CONFIG.md owns talos's own configuration - every config file,
environment variable and database setting it reads - while CONTRIBUTING.md owns
the contribution process itself (how to propose a change, commit conventions,
staging discipline, the review gate) and the configuration of external tooling
such as .publish.yaml, so a root-level config file is not automatically
docs/CONFIG.md's. docs/REVIEW.md owns the house rules a change is reviewed
against - the per-path blocks above, the trees excluded from review, and this
ownership map. docs/AGENTS.md owns each built-in coding agent's exact
configuration and the checklist for adding one. docs/KERNEL.md owns the
kernel's shape and its five rules, and docs/PLUGINS.md owns interface-plugin
authoring. docs/DEVELOPMENT.md owns the dev environment and the runtime
sandbox - CONTRIBUTING.md deliberately defers to it rather than restating it,
so dev-setup facts stay there. docs/RELEASING.md owns the release process and
docs/ORCHESTRATION.md the control-plane pattern. docs/BENCHMARK-MULTIPLEXERS.md
owns how talos compares with raw tmux and Herdr as a host for agent sessions,
and the method of the harness under scripts/bench/ that measures it. packaging/README.md owns the
packaging overview and scripts/dev/README.md the dev-scripts index. README.md
owns the introduction.

AGENTS.md is the agent-facing index into those owners: it carries pointers and
the operating guidance a coding agent needs on every turn, and a code change
that invalidates or extends a documented decision updates the owning doc in the
same change. The per-subsystem working reference lives in the skills under
.agents/skills/ (talos-testing, talos-performance, talos-release,
talos-agents, talos-remote-hosts, talos-cli, talos-extensions,
talos-session-status, talos-kernel, talos-ui-surfaces,
talos-demo-media), which AGENTS.md indexes: detail an agent needs only when
working on that subsystem belongs in its skill rather than back in AGENTS.md,
and a change that invalidates one updates it in the same change. A skill is a
working reference, not an owner - the docs above still own the rationale.
ui/AGENTS.md owns interface-authoring guidance for whichever coding CLI is
editing ui/; ui/CLAUDE.md and ui/GEMINI.md are deliberately one-line pointers
to it, never copies, so do not expand them.

docs/TUTORIAL.md and website/docs/tutorial.html are two separate documents in
different voices covering the same walkthrough, not a generated pair: a step
edited in one is edited in both, and its screenshots are regenerated by
scripts/demo/record-tutorial.sh rather than described.

This repository intentionally has no CHANGELOG.md; release notes are generated
from conventional commits by cocogitto. Do not create one, and do not add a new
documentation file to close a perceived gap when an owner above already covers
the subject.
