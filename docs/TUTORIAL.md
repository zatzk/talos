# Talos tutorial: your first sessions

A walk through the first ten minutes of talos — from an empty screen to two
coding agents running side by side, each on its own git worktree, plus the
handful of commands you will use every day.

Every screenshot below is the real TUI, captured by driving it through this
exact sequence (`scripts/demo/record-tutorial.sh`). The paths in them
(`/tmp/tutorial-home/code/…`) come from the throwaway sandbox the capture runs
in; yours will be your own `~/code`, `~/src`, or wherever you keep repositories.

## Before you start

Install talos (both binaries — the TUI `talos` and the headless
`talos-cli`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zatzk/talos/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Windows is `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zatzk/talos/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex`;
Homebrew, AUR, Nix, winget and Chocolatey are on the
[Installation page](https://talos.zatzk.com/docs/installation.html).

You also need:

- **tmux ≥ 3.2** (or [psmux ≥ 3.3.7](https://github.com/psmux/psmux) on native Windows, or
  opt-in [RMUX ≥ 0.10.0](CONFIG.md#multiplexer-requirements-and-rmux-setup)) —
  it is what keeps your agents alive when talos is closed
- **git**
- **at least one coding-agent CLI** — `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, `opencode`,
  `aider`, `copilot`, … talos launches whichever you have; it is not tied to
  any of them

Nothing to configure. On first launch talos seeds `~/.config/talos/` with
the agents it knows, the themes, and the interface itself.

## 1. Launch it

```bash
talos
```

![An empty talos: the session list on the left, an empty agent pane on the right](../media/tutorial/01-first-launch.png)

Two panes between two bars: the **session list** on the left, the **agent
terminal** on the right, and the keys you need on the footer. There are no
sessions yet, so the list says so.

## 2. Add a repository

Press **`Ctrl+N`**. The creation flow opens on the repo step, with its search
focused: type any part of a repository's path and the list narrows to the
fuzzy matches, best first.

![The repo picker, with only the interface directory in it](../media/tutorial/02-repo-picker.png)

The list is talos's **repo memory** — the repositories you have used before.
On a fresh install it holds one row you did not add: your own interface
directory, offered because editing the panes is a thing you might want a session
for.

To add a repository, press **`Tab`** to move to the **Add Repo Path** field and
type a path. `~` is expanded for you. The field starts at the deepest directory
all your remembered repositories share (home, while there are none), so a bare
name lands next to them; typing `/` or `~` first replaces it with a path of
your own:

![Typing ~/code/ into the Add Repo Path field](../media/tutorial/03-add-repo-path.png)

Two ways to finish from here:

- **`Enter`** adds the path you typed, if it is a repository. A folder that
  does not exist yet reads **Create folder** instead: `Enter` then asks what goes
  into it — a new git repository (`git init`), a clone of an existing one (paste
  its URL), or nothing — makes it, and adds it.
- **`Tab`** browses instead — a listing of that directory, marking which
  subdirectories are git repositories:

![The browse dropdown listing ~/code, with ●git beside two entries](../media/tutorial/04-browse-directory.png)

`↑`/`↓` move, `Enter` on a `●git` row picks it (`Enter` on a plain folder
descends into it).

Either way the repository lands in memory, **selected** (`[x]`), with the cursor
on it — and stays there for next time:

![The repository added to the list and selected](../media/tutorial/05-repo-added.png)

The footer names the rest of what this step does. Letters always go to the
search, so the list's own keys are ones you cannot type:

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `↑`/`↓` | move the cursor |
| `space` | select / deselect a repository (select several for a **multi-repo** session) |
| `Alt+W` | give the selected repository its own **worktree** |
| `Del` / `Alt+D` | forget a remembered repository (with the caret at the end of the search) |
| `Enter` | go on with the ticked repositories — or, with none ticked, the one under the cursor |
| `Ctrl+Enter` / `Alt+Enter` | the same, from the path field too (`Ctrl+Enter` needs a terminal with the kitty keyboard protocol) |
| `Esc` | clear the search; a second `Esc` closes the flow |
| `Alt+P` | import a **folder of repositories** at once — type a parent path, press `Alt+P`, and every git subdirectory is added under one header |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | move between the search and the path field |

## 3. Give the session its own worktree

With the repository selected, press **`Alt+W`**. The `[wt]` mark means this session
gets a **git worktree of its own** rather than your checkout — the agent works
on its own branch, in its own directory, and your working tree is untouched.

![The selected repository marked [wt] for worktree mode](../media/tutorial/06-worktree-mode.png)

Press **`Enter`** when the selection is right. Because a worktree needs
something to branch from, the next step asks which branch:

![The base branch step, offering main](../media/tutorial/07-base-branch.png)

`j`/`k` navigate, `Enter` selects. (Without worktree mode this step does not
appear at all — the session simply runs in the repository as it is.)

## 4. Name it and pick an agent

Name the session after the **work**, not the tool — the list reads as a backlog
that way. `Enter` on an empty field accepts the suggested name (the
repository's own), so you can press straight through.

![The session name step with rate-limit typed](../media/tutorial/08-session-name.png)

The branch name comes next, prefilled from the name you just gave:

![The branch name step, prefilled with rate-limit](../media/tutorial/09-branch-name.png)

Then the agent. This is the list from `~/.config/talos/agents.toml` — the
built-ins talos seeds, plus any CLI you have described yourself. (With only
one agent defined, this step is skipped.)

![The agent picker listing claude, codex, antigravity, opencode, aider, copilot, vibe, pi, omp, shell](../media/tutorial/10-agent-picker.png)

`Enter` creates everything: the worktree, the tmux window, and the agent
running inside it.

## 5. You have a session

![The session list with one session, beside a live agent terminal](../media/tutorial/11-session-running.png)

What you are looking at:

- the session row, grouped under its **repository** (`api-server`), with the
  `⑂` worktree mark, its agent, and a status dot
- the **agent terminal** on the right — a real terminal. Everything you type
  goes to the agent; `Ctrl+O` opens the worktree in your editor, and
  `Ctrl+T`/`F8` gives you a shell in the same directory
- the status dot tracks the agent through **working / blocked / done / idle**,
  reported by the agent's own hooks rather than guessed

Press **`Ctrl+Q`** whenever you like: it detaches. tmux keeps every agent
running, and relaunching `talos` puts you back where you were — after a crash,
a reboot, or a week away.

## 6. The second session is faster

`Ctrl+N` again. The repository is in memory now, so there is nothing to type:
`space` to select it, `Enter`, and through the same steps.

![The repo picker with the remembered repository listed](../media/tutorial/12-repo-remembered.png)

That is the shape of a working day — one session per piece of work, each on its
own branch, all alive at once.

## Everyday keys

The authoritative list is **`F1`** (or `Ctrl+G`), which renders the live key
registry, so it can never drift from what is actually bound. Every chord in it
is rebindable from that screen.

![The keybindings help, rendered from the live registry](../media/tutorial/14-keybindings.png)

The ones worth knowing on day one:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+N` | New session |
| `Ctrl+J` / `Ctrl+K` | Select the next / previous session |
| `Ctrl+H` / `Ctrl+L` | Move focus between panes (the way out of a focused agent) |
| `Ctrl+/` | Search sessions **and the text on their screens** |
| `Ctrl+O` | Open the session's directory in your editor |
| `Ctrl+T` / `F8` | A shell in the session's directory |
| `Ctrl+F` | Fork the session — same repo, branch and agent, with the conversation carried over and the source recorded as its parent |
| `Ctrl+S` | Sync the worktree with its base branch |
| `Ctrl+E` | Rename the session (with the list focused — in a terminal it is end-of-line) |
| `Ctrl+D` | Confirm deleting the session (`Ctrl+Z` undoes it) |
| `Ctrl+U` | Restore a deleted session |
| `Ctrl+Y` / `F4` | Theme picker (36 palettes) |
| `Ctrl+,` / `F6` | Settings — `]` for the Interface tab |
| `F10` | Reload the interface from disk |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit, leaving every agent running |

With the mouse, a click on a session **selects** it and leaves the keyboard in
the list, so `Ctrl+D` asks about the one you pointed at; a **double-click**
opens it, moving the keyboard into its agent pane like `Enter`. The badge at the
bottom-left always names the pane that has the keyboard.

`Ctrl+/` is the one to remember when the list gets long: it matches names,
agents, branches and repositories — and the text on each session's screen, which
is how you find the session with the error in it. Matches highlight **inside**
the panes rather than being reprinted:

![Search, with the query rate and its match highlighted](../media/tutorial/13-search.png)

## The same thing from the command line

`talos-cli` drives the same sessions with no TUI, against the same database —
so anything you do here shows up in a running talos within a tick, and vice
versa. It is on your `PATH` inside every session, which is what lets an agent
orchestrate other agents.

It answers in whichever form suits the reader: an aligned table in your
terminal, and TOON — a compact, agent-friendly encoding — when its output is
piped somewhere. Add `--json` for the complete record when a script needs to
parse it, or `--text` to keep the table down a pipe.

```bash
# What is running
talos-cli                                # live state: sessions, mail, counts
talos-cli session list
talos-cli session list --json | jq       # the full record, for a script

# Start one headlessly, on its own worktree branch
talos-cli session create --name docs --repo-path ~/code/web-app
talos-cli session create --name rate-limit --repo-path ~/code/api-server \
    --agent claude --worktree-branch rate-limit

# Talk to one, and read what it printed
talos-cli session send <uuid> "run the tests and fix what fails"
talos-cli session capture <uuid>

# Clean up (soft by default — `session restore` brings it back)
talos-cli session delete <uuid>
```

![talos-cli session list, a headless session create, and the list again](../media/tutorial/15-cli.png)

Everything else lives under the same tree: `talos-cli config show` prints
every resolved path, `talos-cli plugin dir` prints the interface directory,
and `talos-cli --help` lists the rest (`automation`, `task`, `message`,
`extension`, `editor`, `notify`).

## Where to go next

- **Make it yours** — every pane is a Lua file in a directory you own. Ask an
  agent in any session to change it, or read
  [docs/PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md). `Ctrl+,` then `]` lists every pane and turns
  one off; `F10` reloads.
- **Run a fleet** — [Recipe: provision a monorepo headless](https://talos.zatzk.com/docs/recipes.html#monorepo)
  and [docs/ORCHESTRATION.md](ORCHESTRATION.md).
- **Work on another machine** — declare an SSH host or a WSL distro in
  `~/.config/talos/hosts.toml` and sessions run there while the TUI stays
  local ([docs/CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md)).
- **Configure it** — [docs/CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) is every config file, env var
  and setting in one place; [docs/FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) is why each one
  behaves the way it does.
