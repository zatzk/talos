# Configuration Reference

Every knob talos reads, where it lives, and how it behaves. One file
per audience/lifecycle: hand-edited registries are TOML, the
machine-written keybindings are JSON, and concurrently-written runtime
state lives in SQLite (see ADR-8/ADR-19 in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the
rationale).

`ui/plugins.toml` and `ui/plugins.lock` are the one pair that share a
format and split on lifecycle instead: the spec is composition you
maintain, the lock is a record nothing hand-edits. It is the same split
`.bundled.json` and `ui.json` already make, and the reason is the same —
a merge conflict in the record must not dirty the half a person wrote.

Dev builds (version `0.0.0-dev`) use `talos-dev` in place of
`talos` in every path below, plus a `talos-dev` tmux socket, so a
development checkout never touches your real setup.

## Files at a glance

| File | Format | Edited by | Read | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----------|------|---------|
| `~/.config/talos/agents.toml` | TOML | you | **live** (content poll) | coding-agent CLI definitions |
| `~/.config/talos/hosts.toml` | TOML | you | startup | remote SSH hosts + local WSL distros |
| `~/.config/talos/settings.toml` | TOML | you + `Ctrl+,` panel | **live** (feature flags) / startup (rest) | tuning knobs + feature flags |
| `~/.config/talos/themes.toml` | TOML | you | startup | custom theme palettes |
| `~/.config/talos/hooks.toml` | TOML | you | on each session operation | **session lifecycle hooks** — your commands, run before/after a session is created, deleted, restarted or restored |
| `~/.config/talos/ui/` | Lua | you | **live** (watched, 120 ms debounce; `F10` forces) | **the interface itself** — one file per pane, plus `layout.lua`, `lib/`, `AGENTS.md`/`README.md` for whoever edits it, and a directory per plugin installed from a repository (its own working copy, `.git` included) |
| `~/.config/talos/ui/plugins.toml` | TOML | you (or `talos-cli plugin`) | on each `plugin` command | **what the interface is composed of**: a source, a destination file and an optional pin, per installed pane |
| `~/.config/talos/ui/plugins.lock` | TOML | `talos-cli plugin` | on each `plugin` command | what each entry resolved to, and the digest of every file delivered. Machine-written — commit it beside the spec and the same interface reproduces elsewhere |
| `~/.config/talos/ui.json` | JSON | `F1` / Interface tab (or you) | startup | your decisions *about* the interface: rebound chords, plugins turned off, files trusted, plugin settings, and the action band's order (`"pills": { "<action>": <priority> }`, replacing what the declaring plugin chose — an entry naming an action nothing declares is ignored, not drawn). Written back only by a registry that **read** it (`registry::Origin`), so a process holding no decisions cannot empty it |
| `~/.config/talos/extensions/<name>.toml` | TOML | `talos-cli extension install` | startup + tick | extension manifests (self-healed resources) |
| `~/.config/talos/keybindings.json` | JSON | — | **never** | v1's chord overrides. **Ignored**: rebindings live in `ui.json`. Left alone rather than deleted, so going back to 1.x still finds it |
| `~/.local/share/talos/talos.db` | SQLite | talos | live | sessions, automations, tasks, theme, editor command |
| `~/.local/share/talos/talos.log` | text | talos | — | logs (incl. config warnings). Rotated daily into `talos.log.<date>`; the 30 most recent are kept and older ones deleted at startup |

`agents.toml` and `settings.toml` reload **live**: the TUI checks them about
once per second and applies edits without a restart. The agent registry is
compared by content; settings use mtime. A successful edit shows a toast.
An `agents.toml` reload updates the picker, default, and session-status
coverage together. A missing file, an invalid file, or one with no usable agents
leaves the last good registry in force and reports the error; correcting it is picked
up by the next poll. Existing session records are not changed.
The `ui/` directory reloads live too, but on a **filesystem watcher**
(120 ms debounce) rather than a poll, and `F10` forces one. For
`settings.toml` the flags that apply live are `shell_pane`, `perf_hud`
and `soft_delete`; the restart-only values stay
published through a write-once global (so they can't drift mid-frame),
and the reload toast says when a restart is needed. `hosts.toml` (SSH
backends register at startup) and `themes.toml` need a restart.

`settings.toml` can also be edited from the TUI: **`Ctrl+,`** (alt `F6`)
opens a **Settings panel** listing every knob. It writes the file back
**preserving its comments**, and feature flags that gate UI panels apply
**live** on save; the rest (`mouse`, `notifications`, `automations`,
`version_check`, `auto_update`, the four editable `[notifications]` knobs,
and the scalars) take effect on the next launch — the panel marks those rows
with `⟳` and toasts a restart note. The panel exposes only the four
editable notification knobs (`also_on_waiting`, `suppress_for_active`,
`sound`, `min_interval_secs`); `[notifications] backend` is **not** in
the panel — set it only by hand-editing `settings.toml`. Hand-editing
the file (or the panel in another instance) is picked up the same way,
via the live mtime poll.

All paths respect `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `$XDG_DATA_HOME`.

### Which file do I edit?

A task-to-file map so you don't have to scan every section to find
the right knob:

| I want to… | Edit | Section |
|------------|------|---------|
| Add a coding agent, pin a model, change resume/fork flags | `agents.toml` | [agents.toml](#agentstoml) |
| Run sessions on a remote machine over SSH, or in a local WSL distro | `hosts.toml` | [hosts.toml](#hoststoml) |
| Turn a whole TUI feature on/off (tasks, mouse, notifications…) | `settings.toml` `[features]` | [`[features]`](#features--whole-feature-switches) |
| Tune scrollback, panel breakpoints, audit retention | `settings.toml` | [settings.toml](#settingstoml) |
| Change when/how OS notifications fire | `settings.toml` `[notifications]` | [`[notifications]`](#notifications--os-notification-settings) |
| Add or recolour a TUI theme | `themes.toml` | [themes.toml](#themestoml) |
| Run my own command when a session is created/deleted/restarted/restored, or refuse one | `hooks.toml` | [hooks.toml](#hookstoml) |
| Rebind a key | `keybindings.json` (or the F1 editor) | [keybindings.json](#keybindingsjson) |
| Reorder the action band's buttons | `ui.json` `pills` | [Files at a glance](#files-at-a-glance) |
| Set the `Ctrl+O` editor, pick a theme | (runtime — SQLite) | [SQLite-backed settings](#sqlite-backed-settings) |

None of these files need to exist on a fresh install — every one is
seeded (commented-out where applicable) on first run, and absent files
fall back to built-in defaults.

Config problems are **not silent**: parse errors, unknown fields,
invalid chords, and chord conflicts surface as a status-bar toast on
startup (and in the log file). Unknown TOML keys are tolerated —
stale keys from older versions or typos are *reported by name* but
your file still loads — while syntax/type errors fall back to
built-ins (agents), zero hosts, or defaults (settings).

`agents.toml` degrades **per entry**: a single malformed `[[agents]]`
block (e.g. `args` given a string instead of an array) is skipped with
a toast naming it, and your remaining agents still load — only a
document-level syntax error (or a file with no usable agents) falls
back to the built-ins.

Check everything from the command line:

```bash
talos-cli config validate   # strict parse of every file; exit 1 on problems
talos-cli config show       # effective config + where each value came from
```

`validate` fails on unknown keys (they are typos or leftovers either
way), making it usable as a dotfiles CI gate.

## agents.toml

Declares the launchable coding agents. Seeded with the built-ins
(`claude`, `codex`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `aider`, `copilot`, `vibe`, `pi`,
`omp`) on
first run; edit or add `[[agents]]` entries to support any CLI — no
recompile. A malformed `[[agents]]` entry is skipped (with a toast
naming it) and the rest still load; only a document-level syntax error
falls back to the built-ins. Either way the error is shown.

The file is **seeded once** and never rewritten — so it stays yours to
edit, but a talos **update that adds a new built-in agent does not
merge it into an existing `agents.toml`**. To pick up a newly-bundled
agent, add its `[[agents]]` block by hand (copy it from this file's
built-in list) or delete `agents.toml` to re-seed the full set. The
matching status hook is wired automatically once the agent's config dir
exists — the built-in hooks extension self-heals on every startup/tick,
independent of `agents.toml`.

```toml
config_version = 1
default = "claude"          # agent preselected in the picker / headless spawns

[[agents]]
name = "claude"             # display + lookup name (unique)
command = "claude"          # executable
args = []                   # always passed; bake a model here if you want one
resume_args = ["--resume", "{id}"]            # emitted when resuming
fork_args = ["--resume", "{id}", "--fork-session"]
new_session_args = ["--session-id", "{id}"]   # emitted on a fresh spawn
resume_latest = false       # true = id-less "resume last session in cwd"
# hook_schema = "claude"    # optional: name the hook FAMILY this CLI speaks so
                            #   the built-in hooks extension wires its status
                            #   hooks under this custom agent's name too
```

`{id}` is substituted with the talos-generated session UUID. `{home}`
is substituted with the resolved home dir at spawn time (the remote home
for an SSH/WSL host) — for an agent that wants a session *file path*
rather than a bare id. The built-in `omp` (Oh My Pi) uses it: it generates
its own internal id and won't take talos's, but its `--session <path>`
creates a fresh session at a missing path, so talos maps its UUID to a
deterministic `--session {home}/.omp/agent/sessions/talos-{id}.jsonl`
(creation) / `--resume` the same (restart). `{home}` is expanded by
talos, not the shell — args are POSIX-quoted, so a literal `~` would
never expand. `omp` ships no `fork_args`, so `Ctrl+F` starts a fresh
session (OMP has no way to pin a fork's target file to a talos UUID).
Groups
are emitted only when their driving value exists; precedence is
fork > resume > new-session. See the seeded file's comments and
the `talos-agents` skill for the `resume_latest` semantics.

### How `command` is resolved

For a **local** session, talos resolves a bare `command` against **its own
`PATH`** and hands the multiplexer the absolute path it found. It does that
because the multiplexer would otherwise resolve the name itself, in an
environment talos neither chose nor can see:

- tmux copies the *client's* `PATH` into a new pane only for an **unattached**
  client, so a window created over talos's (attached) control-mode connection
  — a restart, a plugin program, the companion shell pane — got the `PATH` of
  whatever first started the tmux **server**.
- a window command that reaches tmux as a **single** argument is run by tmux's
  `default-shell`, not `execvp` — so an agent with no args was launched by a
  shell talos never chose, under that shell's `PATH` and quoting.

Under zsh/bash those `PATH`s agree, because the interactive additions live in
`~/.zshenv` / `~/.profile`, which any shell that starts a tmux server sources.
Under **fish** they do not: `fish_add_path` writes `fish_user_paths`, which only
fish applies — so a server started from anything else never sees the agent, for
the life of that server, and the spawn fails with a shell's `command not found`
(exit **127**; an `execvp` failure is exit 1).

That is not the only thing a 127 there can mean, and talos does not read the
exit status as the verdict at all — see
[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md#session-creation) for the hook that also produces
one.

Resolution is **best-effort and never a new way to fail**: a `command` that is
already a path, that nothing on `PATH` matches (a shell function or alias, or a
binary installed after talos started), or that runs on Windows is passed
through verbatim, exactly as before. A **remote** (SSH/WSL) session is not
resolved either — its `PATH` is the host's: the host's login-shell `PATH`
(read once per host, see [hosts.toml](#hoststoml) → `path_prepend`) ahead of
what ssh / `wsl.exe` give a command, and its window command is wrapped in a
login shell.

Only **absolute** `PATH` entries are considered. That excludes the empty entry
POSIX reads as "the current directory" (`:/usr/bin`, or a stray trailing colon),
because the resolved path is handed to a process with a working directory of its
own — honouring it would let a `claude` sitting in the repo you are working on
shadow the real one, which is the dependence this removes rather than moves.

### What happens when it is *not* installed

talos starts with no multiplexer and no agent on the machine, and that is
deliberate — browsing, reading and configuring must work on a fresh box. So the
same lookup runs a second time, as a **preflight**, in the places where knowing
early is worth something:

- the **create-session flow** marks an agent whose `command` resolves nowhere
  (`⚠ not installed`) and says so on the step that offers it, and states a
  missing multiplexer from the flow's first step. It never blocks: the answer is
  a warning on the choice, because a `command` may still be launchable (a shell
  function, or something installed a second later).
- the **empty session list** — the one screen a first run always reaches — says
  the multiplexer is missing, with the fix.
- a **spawn failure** caused by a missing binary names the binary, the
  directories talos searched and the one thing to do about it, instead of the
  launcher's errno or the multiplexer's exit code.
- `talos-cli doctor` answers the whole question directly: the multiplexer and
  its version, every registered agent's `command`, the launcher for each
  configured host, and the full search path. It is the companion to `talos-cli
  session doctor`, which asks whether an *existing* session's status hooks are
  wired.

The probe is a `stat` per absolute `PATH` entry per binary — no process spawn —
and it runs on the kernel's own schedule behind a 10-second window, never on a
render, a keystroke or a list row. Two things are reported as **unknown** rather
than missing, because in both cases nothing was looked at: a **remote host**,
whose binaries live on the host, and a **relative** `command` such as
`./bin/agent`, which is resolved by whoever launches it from the *session's*
own directory. Answering the latter from talos's working directory would call
a binary that launches fine missing, and one that does not present — the same
"absolute only" rule the resolver above is written under, for the same reason.

The advice is platform-specific and never invented. A Windows user is pointed at
[psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux), never at `tmux`; where the install
command depends on a distribution, the package name is given and the link is
tmux's own [install page](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) rather
than a guessed invocation. A missing **agent** is answered with the `agents.toml`
entry that decides what gets run, because talos bakes in no knowledge of any
agent's installer.

`hook_schema` is optional. Custom agents are agent-neutral, so the built-in
**hooks** extension normally wires status hooks only for the built-ins it knows
by name. Set `hook_schema = "claude"` on a **rebranded** agent (one whose
`command` runs `claude` under a different `name`) and it inherits claude's hook
wiring — the `--settings` patch locally, and the same rewrite on a remote/WSL
host. It names the *family* to imitate, not a boolean; see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#hook_schema-custom-rebrands-only) for which family is
actually useful today and why.

The seeded file also ships two commented, copy-pasteable templates
below the built-ins — **Add your own agent** (every field annotated)
and **Pin a model** (a `claude-opus` variant baking `--model opus`
into `args`). Both stay commented, so a fresh install still resolves
to exactly the ten built-ins (nine coding agents plus `shell`).

For **each built-in's** exact config and runtime behavior (resume/fork
semantics, ID model, and which status-hook mechanism it uses), and the
checklist for **adding a new built-in**, see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## hosts.toml

Declares off-local hosts — **remote SSH machines** and **local WSL
distros**. Each `[[hosts]]` entry registers a session backend named
`ssh:<name>` (default kind) or `wsl:<name>`. Seeded fully commented-out
(fresh installs are local-only for SSH). Malformed file → zero
configured hosts, error shown.

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `name` | yes | — | backend id `ssh:<name>` / `wsl:<name>`; what `--host` expects |
| `kind` | no | `ssh` | transport: `ssh` (remote machine) or `wsl` (local distro) |
| `destination` | for ssh | — | ssh target (`user@host` or `~/.ssh/config` alias) |
| `distro` | no | `name` | WSL distro name (`kind = "wsl"` only) |
| `ssh_opts` | no | `[]` | extra ssh flags, one token per element (ssh only) |
| `socket` | no | `talos` | host `tmux -L` socket |
| `session` | no | `talos` | host tmux session name |
| `worktrees_dir` | no | host `$HOME/.local/share/talos/worktrees` | absolute worktrees dir on the host/distro |
| `multiplexer` | no | platform default | host preference for new sessions; an explicit per-create choice wins. Names are `tmux`, `psmux`, `rmux`, and `herdr` (no Herdr adapter yet). Use `psmux` for a native Windows SSH host |
| `platform` | no | `windows` if `multiplexer = "psmux"`, else `posix` | the host's OS: `posix` or `windows`. Decides its shell and paths, independent of `multiplexer` (ssh only — a WSL distro is always `posix`) |
| `share_sessions` | no | `true` | the host's own database is the record of its sessions: mirrored here, operated through the host's `talos-cli` (provisioned under `~/.local/share/talos/bin/` — `talos-dev/bin/` for a dev build — there when missing); `false` = drive the host from here as before |
| `path_prepend` | no | `[]` | directories put first on the agent's `PATH` on the host, absolute or `~/`-rooted (`~` = the host's `$HOME`) — for what the host's login shell cannot report |

**The agent's `PATH` on a host.** ssh and `wsl.exe` hand a command a
non-login environment — `wsl.exe -e` skips the user's shell entirely, so
not even `~/.zshenv` is read — which has none of `~/.local/bin`,
`~/.cargo/bin`, nvm/fnm and the like. So talos reads the host's login
`PATH` once per host and process (`$SHELL -lc`, the passwd shell when
`$SHELL` is unset, and `/bin/sh -lc`; stdin closed, never `-i`, 5 s each
under `timeout`, 15 s overall) and gives every command it runs there —
the delegated `talos-cli`, and so the agent's pane — `path_prepend`,
then the login shells' `PATH`, then the launcher's own (on WSL that
includes the Windows `PATH` WSL appends unless `appendWindowsPath =
false`), each directory once. A host whose shells cannot be read keeps
the launcher's `PATH` with a warning in the log; session creation never
waits longer than the timeout on it, and never fails for it.

**SSH** auth comes entirely from your `~/.ssh/config`; talos never
handles credentials. **WSL** distros are reached with
`wsl.exe -d <distro>` and need no config entry at all — they are
**auto-discovered** (`wsl.exe -l -q`) and appear in the host picker
and `--host` automatically; add a `kind = "wsl"` entry only to override
a default (e.g. `worktrees_dir`). Discovery also works from *inside* a
distro (interop puts `wsl.exe` on `PATH` there), and excludes the distro
talos is itself running in: that one is this machine, sessions on it
are ordinary **local** sessions created with no `--host`. An entry whose
`distro` is that one is ignored with a startup warning. An entry merely
*named* after it — reaching a sibling — works as written and keeps its
sessions, but it records them under the very name an older talos
mislabelled *local* sessions with; the two are indistinguishable, so
talos warns and leaves every row under that name alone (any local
session still recorded there stays recorded there). Name a **new** entry
after the distro it reaches and there is nothing to warn about; renaming
an **existing** one moves no row, and leaves its recorded sessions
behind under a name no host registers.
For both kinds, the multiplexer, git, the agent,
and worktrees all run **on the host / inside the distro** at native
paths (a WSL distro's worktrees live in its own Linux filesystem, not on
`/mnt/c`); the distro needs its selected multiplexer (`tmux` >= 3.2 by default,
or opt-in RMUX >= 0.10.0) and `git`. Host changes require a restart
(the registry is read once and each host's `$HOME` is
cached for the process lifetime).

### Host platform

A host's **platform** (`posix` or `windows`) is its operating system, and it is
a choice of its own: not the multiplexer, not the way the host is reached, and
not the OS talos itself runs on. It decides the host's shell and path
semantics — PowerShell, `%USERPROFILE%` and no `/bin/sh` on Windows; `sh -c`,
`$HOME` and `/bin/sh` as the server's `default-command` on POSIX — so a Windows
talos driving a WSL distro pins `/bin/sh` there, and a Windows host on a
multiplexer other than psmux still gets PowerShell.

An entry that does not set `platform` keeps the meaning it always had:
`multiplexer = "psmux"` is Windows, anything else POSIX. A WSL distro is POSIX
whatever its entry says. What a multiplexer can do is not the platform's to
say either: whether talos polls a backend for dead panes is whether that
multiplexer reports a closed window (tmux does; psmux and RMUX need polling).

### Multiplexer choice and existing sessions

Host and multiplexer are separate choices. `hosts.toml` names the host's
preference; top-level `multiplexer` in `settings.toml` names the local
preference. `talos-cli session create --multiplexer <name>` overrides either
for one creation. The TUI asks for a host and then shows the registered
multiplexers for it. The order is explicit choice, configured host or local
preference, then platform default (`tmux` on POSIX, `psmux` on native Windows).
The TUI keeps that default selected. Where both are offered, it places `rmux`
immediately after `tmux`. The local picker offers `rmux` only while its binary
resolves on `PATH`; a remote host's binaries cannot be checked locally, so its
registered choices remain visible.
If a configured choice is unavailable, the TUI requires an explicit selection
of another offered multiplexer before continuing.
Names are `tmux`, `psmux`, `rmux`, and `herdr`. A configured choice without a
registered implementation is shown as unavailable and creation refuses it
before making a worktree or pane.
When creation is delegated to a host's own Talos CLI, that CLI advertises
whether it accepts a multiplexer choice. Older compatible CLIs can still use
their platform default; a non-default choice requires updating the host CLI.

The resolved choice is recorded in each new session's `backend_type`, its
**route**. One parser (`session::Route`) reads every spelling a row has ever
carried:

| `backend_type` | machine | multiplexer |
|---|---|---|
| `""`, `tmux`, `local-tmux` | this one | unqualified |
| `local:<mux>` | this one | `<mux>` |
| `local-<mux>` (read only, any mux but tmux) | this one | `<mux>` |
| `ssh:<host>`, `wsl:<distro>` | that host | unqualified |
| `ssh:<host>:<mux>`, `wsl:<distro>:<mux>` | that host | `<mux>` |

Every machine is qualified the same way, `<machine>:<mux>`. New rows always
name their multiplexer (`ssh:devbox:tmux`, `local:psmux`), so
a later change of preference cannot reinterpret them. Rows written before
routes did are **unqualified**, are never migrated, and keep the meaning they
were written with: a local one is the platform default, and a remote one is
psmux when the host's `multiplexer` is `psmux` and tmux otherwise. So a host
whose preference moves to `rmux` still has its old rows attached, deleted,
torn down and polled with tmux.

`local-tmux` was written for the platform default before routes named a
multiplexer, which is psmux on native Windows, so it still reads that way
there. An explicit local tmux is `local:tmux`, so the two can no longer be
confused. An older build does not know the `local:` spelling and cannot attach
a local session created by this one.

A host name may not contain `:`, which separates it from the multiplexer in a
route. `hosts.toml` ignores such an entry with a warning, and
`config validate` fails naming it.

Which multiplexers work is what is **registered**, never the OS: every
multiplexer an adapter implements (`tmux`, `psmux`, and `rmux`) is registered for
this machine and for every host, whatever either's platform or preference — a
binary that is not installed is reported by name when a session first needs
it. A route naming a multiplexer no adapter implements (`herdr` today)
is refused by name, and is neither created nor driven with another binary. A
force-delete or reap of a local row on a multiplexer this machine does not run
refuses rather than removing a
checkout or killing a local window of the same name; a delete without
`--force` still works and leaves it restorable. An adapter for another multiplexer
registers its own routes; it must read them on restart, restore, delete,
input, capture, and fork.

### Multiplexer requirements and RMUX setup

Use the latest stable release of the selected multiplexer. These are the
minimums enforced by the adapters, checked against upstream on 2026-10-03;
no runtime floor changed in this documentation update.

| Multiplexer | Minimum | Code enforcing it | Upstream evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) | 3.2 | [`MIN_TMUX_VERSION` and `check_min_version`](../src/backend/tmux.rs) | [3.2 changes](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/3.2/CHANGES): control-client flow control and format subscriptions |
| [psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux) | 3.3.7 | [`MIN_PSMUX_VERSION` and `check_psmux_version`](../src/backend/psmux.rs) | [3.3.7 release](https://github.com/psmux/psmux/releases/tag/v3.3.7): dead warm-pane fix (psmux#450) |
| [RMUX](https://github.com/Helvesec/rmux) | 0.10.0 | [`Rmux::check_banner`](../src/backend/rmux.rs) | [0.10.0 release](https://github.com/Helvesec/rmux/releases/tag/v0.10.0): wire protocol 8, incompatible with 0.9.x daemons |

For tmux, the limiting features are `refresh-client -f pause-after=5`,
`refresh-client -A` (pane monitoring/resume), and `refresh-client -B`
(format subscriptions), added in 3.2. Control mode arrived in 1.8;
`send-keys -H` and pane options in 3.0; `set-clipboard external` in 2.6;
`resize-window` in 2.9. These are recorded in the same upstream changelog.
The mouse-state seed in
[`pane_state_seed`](../src/backend/tmux_compat/server.rs) uses six
`#{mouse_*_flag}` formats: all are present in upstream
[3.2 format.c](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/3.2/format.c).
The changelog records the SGR/UTF-8 mouse formats in 3.0; the source confirms
the floor rather than assuming a newer requirement from the current manual.
Unknown flags expand empty and the seed falls back to press reporting when
only `mouse_any_flag` is set. `extended-keys-format` arrived in
[3.5](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/3.5/CHANGES) but is optional: its
rejection is tolerated on 3.2–3.4. See ADR-12 for the control setup.

psmux's floor is its own release version, not a claim of tmux feature parity.
Older releases can spawn dead panes after console attach/detach; 3.3.7 fixes
that. The adapter checks both the client banner and the running server's
`#{version}`. RMUX checks its `rmux -V` banner instead: its `#{version}` is
the tmux compatibility version, not the RMUX release.

Recorded integration evidence is tmux 3.2/3.2a and 3.5a/3.7c (ADR-12),
psmux 3.3.8 on Windows 11 (ADR-13), and RMUX 0.10.0 on Linux
([#1322](https://github.com/zatzk/talos/pull/1322)). This is historical
evidence, not a claim that every platform was retested for this doc change.
The latest upstream stable releases checked on 2026-10-03 were tmux 3.7c,
psmux 3.3.8, and RMUX 0.10.0.

RMUX is a Rust terminal multiplexer with a tmux-compatible command interface.
It is opt-in and never changes the platform defaults. Install it separately
on the machine running the sessions, following its
[installation guide](https://github.com/Helvesec/rmux/tree/v0.10.0#installation).
For example, `cargo install rmux --locked` installs the latest published
crate; check `rmux -V` afterwards. Release archives need their complete
package layout: on Unix run the archive's `./install.sh --prefix ~/.local`,
and keep its `bin/` and `libexec/`; do not copy just the executable.

Press **Ctrl+N**, choose the host if prompted, then choose **RMUX** immediately
after tmux in the multiplexer picker. Locally RMUX appears only when `rmux`
resolves on `PATH`; host choices remain visible without a remote binary probe.
To make it the default for new local sessions, set this top-level value in
`settings.toml`:

```toml
multiplexer = "rmux"
```

For an SSH host, add `multiplexer = "rmux"` to its `[[hosts]]` entry. For WSL,
add a configured `kind = "wsl"` entry matching the discovered distro and set
that same preference; install RMUX inside the distro. An explicit
`talos-cli session create --multiplexer rmux` overrides the preference
(add the usual session name, repository and agent arguments).
Existing tmux and psmux rows retain their recorded routes.

| RMUX placement | Talos integration evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Local Linux | Live creation, TUI attachment, input and pane-deletion/relaunch in #1322 |
| Local macOS | Upstream ships macOS binaries; talos integration unverified |
| SSH host | Adapter and route construction covered; real-host execution unverified |
| WSL distro | Picker and route construction covered; distro execution unverified |
| Native Windows | Upstream ships Windows binaries; talos integration unverified, so keep the psmux default |

RMUX 0.10.0 rejects `pause-after`, `refresh-client -A`, and subscriptions
(`refresh-client -B`). Talos omits those commands, uses one reply block for
command lists, and polls pane liveness and remote hook options. Output buffering
therefore relies on RMUX rather than tmux's pause/resume mechanism. See
[ADR-31](ARCHITECTURE.md#adr-31-tmux-and-psmux-are-peer-adapters-over-one-tmux-protocol-server)
and [#1320](https://github.com/zatzk/talos/pull/1320).

If RMUX is absent from the local picker, check `rmux -V` in the environment
that launches talos. For a host, check it on that host or inside the WSL
distro. A version rejection needs an upgrade on the session machine.
RMUX 0.9.x daemons cannot talk to a 0.10.0 client: stop the old server before
upgrading, using `rmux -L <socket> kill-server` for each affected socket.
This stops its sessions; finish or save the agents' work first. A change of
preference does not convert existing sessions, so use the recorded route's
multiplexer when attaching manually or stopping a server.

A socket learned from a host's own CLI (`version --json`'s `tmux_socket`) is
kept per **host**, not per route: it is the address of the talos instance
there (ADR-12), which every multiplexer on that host runs under. Why routes
are read this way, and what it costs, is ADR-28 in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Manual deletion of an agent pane or window means the agent should run again.
Once the backend **confirms absence**, Talos relaunches the same session ID,
agent, and worktree once. An exited pane still held by the server remains
visible for inspection. A backend that is unreachable or has not verified the
window cannot authorize a relaunch. A session intentionally parked with
`session stop` stays stopped. A deleted companion shell is forgotten without
relaunching the agent. RMUX's local headless and TUI-open pane-deletion paths
have live tests; Herdr remains unverified.

## hooks.toml

Declares **session lifecycle hooks**: your own shell commands, run by
talos before and after it creates, deletes, restarts or restores a
session. Seeded fully commented-out (a fresh install runs nothing); read
**each time an event fires**, so an edit is in force at the next
operation with no restart. Malformed file → no hooks run, warning in the
log, and `config validate` fails.

> Not the `hooks/` **directory** beside it. That is the home of the
> built-in `hooks` *extension*, which installs status-hook files **into**
> the agent CLIs so they can tell talos what they are doing
> (see [Session status](#session-status)). `hooks.toml` is the other
> direction: talos telling *your* scripts what *it* is doing.

```toml
[[hooks]]
event = "session.pre_create"
command = 'case "$TALOS_BRANCH" in main|master) echo "refusing: protected branch" >&2; exit 1;; esac'

[[hooks]]
event = "session.post_create"
command = '[ -n "$TALOS_CWD" ] && cp -n .env.local "$TALOS_CWD/.env"; true'
timeout_secs = 120
```

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| `event` | yes | — | one of the eight events below |
| `command` | yes | — | run through `sh -c` (`cmd /C` on Windows) |
| `timeout_secs` | no | `30` | the hook is killed after this long |

**Events** — a `pre_*` fires before the operation has any side effect, a
`post_*` after it has fully succeeded (never after a failure):

| Operation | Events | Fired by |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| create (incl. fork) | `session.pre_create` / `session.post_create` | the creation flow, `Ctrl+F`, `talos-cli session create`, a `spawn` automation, an extension's sessions |
| delete (soft or force) | `session.pre_delete` / `session.post_delete` | `Ctrl+D`, `talos-cli session delete [--force]`, extension uninstall |
| restart | `session.pre_restart` / `session.post_restart` | `Ctrl+R`, `talos-cli session restart` |
| restore (incl. undo) | `session.pre_restore` / `session.post_restore` | `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+U`, `talos-cli session restore` |

Hooks fire **once per operation whichever interface asked**, because
every interface ends in the same pipeline (`session_ops`). Hooks for one
event run one at a time, in file order.

**A `pre_*` hook can refuse.** Exit non-zero (or exceed the timeout) and
the operation is aborted before it has done anything — no worktree, no
process, no row changed — with the hook's command, exit status and the
tail of its stderr as the reported reason (the in-flight error in the
TUI, the error and exit status of `talos-cli`). Later hooks for that
event do not run. **A `post_*` hook is informational**: every one runs,
a failure is logged to `talos.log` and carried in the CLI's JSON
(`hook_failures`), and never fails the operation. Each `post_*` is also
delivered to interface plugins as an event of the same name (`events = {
"session.post_create" }` + `on_event`; `docs/PLUGINS.md` → Events) — the
Lua side of the same vocabulary, informational for the same reason.

**What a hook receives.** Environment variables — **unset** (never
empty) when the fact is not known at that moment:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `TALOS_HOOK_EVENT` | the event name, e.g. `session.post_create` |
| `TALOS_SESSION` | the talos session id (at `pre_create`: the id it will have if creation succeeds) |
| `TALOS_SESSION_ID` | the agent's own conversation id |
| `TALOS_SESSION_NAME` | the session name |
| `TALOS_AGENT` | the agent name |
| `TALOS_REPO` | the primary repository path |
| `TALOS_CWD` | the directory the agent runs in (the worktree, or the symlink workspace of a multi-repo session); unset at `pre_create` |
| `TALOS_BRANCH` / `TALOS_BASE_BRANCH` | the worktree branch and what it was created from (base: create events only) |
| `TALOS_HOST` | the remote host name; unset for a local session |
| `TALOS_PARENT_SESSION` | the parent session id (a fork, or `--parent`) |
| `TALOS_TASK` | the originating task id, for a task-spawned session |
| `TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` / `TALOS_DATA_DIR` | so a `talos-cli` run inside the hook hits the database of the talos that fired it |

The same facts — plus `worktrees` (`repo_path`, `worktree_path`,
`branch`), `additional_dirs`, `force` (delete) and `force_deleted`
(restore) — arrive as **one JSON object on stdin** (`jq -r .cwd`).

**Where and how it runs.** In the primary repository when that is a
directory on this machine, otherwise in talos's own working directory
— the repository is the one path that exists at every event (at
`pre_create` the worktree is not made; at `post_delete` it is gone).
With **no terminal**: stdin is the JSON, stdout/stderr are captured and
only their tail (500 chars) is reported, so a hook can neither draw on
nor read from the TUI's screen. A hook for a **remote** (SSH/WSL)
session still runs **locally**; `TALOS_HOST` names the host and the
paths are the host's — `ssh "$TALOS_HOST" …` from the hook is your
call.

`talos-cli config validate` strict-parses the file; `config show`
lists the hooks in force.

Scalar tuning knobs plus the `[features]` switches, seeded fully
commented-out (defaults apply when absent). Only knobs a user plausibly
wants are exposed; internals stay hardcoded. The seed closes with a
**Common recipes** block — copy-pasteable groupings (bigger scrollback,
a minimal/focused TUI, notification tuning, enabling the update badge),
all commented so defaults still apply out of the box.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `multiplexer` | platform default | multiplexer preference for new local sessions; explicit per-create choice wins |
| `scrollback_lines` | `1000` | terminal scrollback kept per session — and how far back global search reaches |
| `hidden_terminal_secs` | `30` | how long a session can be off screen before its terminal grid is dropped (rebuilt from tmux when shown or searched); `0` keeps every grid |
| `two_panel_min_cols` | `80` | width below which only the terminal renders |
| `three_panel_min_cols` | `120` | width unlocking the optional third column |
| `audit_retention_days` | `90` | audit + session-event history kept (pruned on startup) |
| `git_poll_secs` | `5` | how often each session's git worktree is re-statted; `0` turns it off |

### `hidden_terminal_secs` — how much memory a session off screen holds

tmux parses every pane and keeps its screen and history. The interface parses
them a second time to draw them, into a grid of 32 bytes a cell plus
`scrollback_lines` rows of history, so a 200-column session with a full
history costs about 6 MiB, whether you look at it or not. With this set, a
session that has been off screen for this many seconds drops that grid, and
one not shown since the interface started never builds it. It keeps reading
its output meanwhile: its title, a bell or notification, and whether it is
printing are reported as before.

Showing the session, or a search reaching it, reads the pane back from tmux.
That is a round trip and a parse, about 10 ms for a 200x50 pane with 1,000
lines of history, so switching to a session hidden longer than this takes that
long to draw. A search whose strip was just opened reads each such session the
same way before the first keystroke. `0` keeps every grid for as long as the
session runs, which is how talos behaved before (ADR-P27 in
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md)). psmux (Windows) cannot hand a pane back in
step with its output, so its sessions always keep their grids. Read at startup.

### `git_poll_secs` — how much `git` talos runs

The diffstat and the ahead/behind beside each session come from `git`, and
they are *polled*: every session, every `git_poll_secs`. So this one number,
times the session count, is talos's whole git load — and a session whose
branch is ahead of the default and has not landed yet pays for the merge
check as well, which is seven subprocesses rather than one.

```text
one poll of one session
  git status --porcelain=v2 --branch     always
  git diff --numstat HEAD                only when a tracked file differs
  ┌ symbolic-ref origin/HEAD             ┐
  │ merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD …      │  the merge check: only while the
  │ diff --quiet origin/main HEAD        ├─ branch is ahead and unlanded, and
  │ merge-base / cherry / commit-tree    │  at most once a minute per commit
  └ cherry                               ┘
```

Two things keep that from scaling with the session list, and neither needs
configuring: an answer that comes back **unchanged** stretches that session's
own interval — doubling each time, up to 12× `git_poll_secs` — and the first
change resets it, so a dormant session is re-statted a twelfth as often; and
the merge check's answer is remembered against the commit it was computed for
and rechecked on the first poll at least a minute later — so its age is bounded
by a minute or by that session's own interval, whichever is longer.

Raise `git_poll_secs` on an instance holding many sessions, and set it to `0`
where a process launch is expensive for reasons outside talos — **Microsoft
Defender / Intune on macOS, or Defender for Endpoint on Windows, scans every
process as it is created**, which turns a poll into an antivirus workload. At
`0` nothing is statted, so the session list shows no diffstat and **a delete
always asks for confirmation** — the confirmation reads a session's git state to
describe what may be lost, and "could not be read" is reported rather than
treated as clean. It is the same prompt
a remote session already gets. `talos-cli` is unaffected. Read once at
startup, so a change applies on the next launch.

### `[features]` — whole-feature switches

Switch off behaviour that reaches outside the interface. All default to
`true` — as of 1.0 that includes `version_check` and `auto_update`, which
both reach the network (they were opt-in before 1.0). `shell_pane`,
`perf_hud` and `soft_delete` apply **live** on save; `automations`,
`mouse`, `notifications`, `version_check` and `auto_update` take effect on
the next launch. Data is never touched, so re-enabling a flag is lossless.

**A pane is not switched off here.** Panes are files, so turning one off
is `space` on its row in the Interface tab (`Ctrl+,` then `]`), recorded
in `ui.json`. That does strictly more than a flag could: it works for a
plugin *you* wrote, which no compiled-in flag could know about.

Five keys are **accepted and ignored**: `tasks`, `file_viewer`,
`info_panel`, `code_review` and `global_search`. They gated v1 panes the
binary no longer draws, and nothing reads them now — not even the plugins
that give `code_review` and `info_panel` back
([`talos-code-review`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-code-review),
[`talos-info-panel`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-info-panel)),
which are switched on and off from the Interface tab like any other pane.
They are still parsed rather than rejected, so an existing `settings.toml`
keeps loading instead of failing on an unknown key — but setting one has no
effect in either direction. Same for `three_panel_min_cols` above.

| Key | Default | Controls |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `shell_pane` | `true` | per-session shell toggle (`Ctrl+T`) |
| `perf_hud` | `true` | perf HUD overlay (`F12`): live perf counters, frame/tick timing and the per-pane cost table (see `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`) |
| `automations` | `true` | TUI schedule firing + heartbeat arming (the CLI stays fully functional) |
| `mouse` | `true` | mouse capture: clicks, wheel, drag-select, hover, scrollbars |
| `notifications` | `true` | OS desktop notifications when a session needs attention |
| `soft_delete` | `true` | TUI `Ctrl+D` asks, then soft-deletes (Ctrl+Z undo); off = hard delete after the same confirmation prompt |
| `version_check` | `true` | GitHub update check: TUI header "update available" badge + `talos-cli version --check` |
| `auto_update` | `true` | Silent self-update **within the current major**: download + verify + replace the binaries on startup + `talos-cli update`; also auto-refreshes stale extensions |

`automations = false` is a full stop on the TUI side: the pane
disappears (the session list takes the whole left column and `j`/`k`
wrap within it), and the TUI neither fires due schedules nor arms the
heartbeat keeper on startup. Explicit `talos-cli automation`
commands still work — and `automation create` still arms the
heartbeat, so an already-armed keeper window (or an OS timer from
`packaging/`) keeps firing schedules externally. Disabling
`shell_pane` hides existing shell panes but never kills their
processes. `mouse = false` skips terminal mouse capture entirely, so
the terminal keeps its native mouse behavior (its own text selection,
URL handling, etc.) and no click/wheel/hover handling runs in the TUI.
`notifications = false` keeps the background dispatcher thread from
ever starting (zero overhead) and silently no-ops every transition;
the session status display itself is unaffected.

`soft_delete = false` turns the TUI's `Ctrl+D` into a destructive
**hard delete**: instead of marking the row deleted with a `Ctrl+Z`
undo window, it kills the session's tmux window, removes its worktrees
and symlink workspace, and disables any pending `Send` automations —
after a confirmation prompt (`Enter`/`y` to delete, `Esc`/`n` to
cancel), since the teardown is irreversible. The row is marked
**first**, before anything comes down: a crash partway through the
teardown would otherwise leave an active session whose worktrees are
already gone. It is marked force-deleted with it, so `Ctrl+U` lists it
and refuses — unless every worktree was one talos merely opened
rather than created, in which case nothing was lost and the restore
stands (which re-spawns it fresh). This flag governs the TUI only:
`talos-cli session delete` always soft-deletes unless you pass
`--force`, regardless of the setting.
With `soft_delete = true`, the TUI also asks before the reversible delete and
records the `Ctrl+Z` undo target only after the answer is yes.

`version_check` (on by default for 1.0) enables the update check — it
makes a network call. On launch the TUI reads a cached result
(`~/.local/share/talos/version-check.json`) and, if it is older than
24 h, fires a single best-effort background fetch of GitHub's latest
release (`api.github.com/repos/zatzk/talos/releases/latest`, via
`curl`/`wget` — no new dependency); a newer release shows a `⬆ vX.Y.Z
available` badge next to the version in the header. The fetch never runs
on the render path and never blocks startup; failures are silent. Dev
builds (`0.0.0-dev`) never show the badge. The same flag enables
`talos-cli version --check`, which fetches fresh on demand and reports
current vs. latest (`talos-cli version` with no flag always prints the
current version, regardless of the flag).

`auto_update` (on by default for 1.0) goes a step further than
`version_check`: instead of just showing a badge, the TUI **silently
updates itself** on startup. On every
launch (it does **not** reuse the `version_check` badge's 24 h cache — sharing
that gate let the badge keep the cache "fresh" and starve the updater) it
fetches the latest release tag; if a newer release exists it downloads that
release's tarball + checksums from GitHub Releases (`curl`/`wget`, no new
dependency), verifies the SHA256 **in process** (`sha2`, so the check does not
depend on the local `PATH` — shelling out to `sha256sum`/`shasum` made it
impossible on native Windows, issue #1182), extracts it
(`tar`, or PowerShell's `Expand-Archive` for Windows' zip), and atomically
replaces the installed `talos`/`talos-cli`
binaries in place — mirroring `scripts/install.sh`. The download is verified
**before** any installed file is touched, so a failed/corrupt download leaves
the current binaries untouched; the whole step runs before the TUI takes the
terminal and is best-effort (any failure is logged and startup continues on
the current version). The replaced binary takes effect on the **next launch**
(the running process keeps its open file), so the TUI shows an "Updated to
vX.Y.Z — restart to apply" status line. `talos-cli update` performs the
same update on demand (with `--force` to bypass the up-to-date, dev-build and
major-version guards); dev builds (`0.0.0-dev`) never auto-update. The default install
location (`~/.local/bin`) is user-writable; a system-wide install in a
root-owned directory will fail the replace (logged, non-fatal). `version_check`
and `auto_update` are independent — enable either or both.

**Windows takes the same path, with two differences.** It used to be refused
outright, which made a default-on `auto_update` silently mean nothing there
(issue #1172). The release artifact is the `.zip` `install.ps1` extracts, so the
unpacker is chosen by the archive's extension. And a rename cannot replace an
executable a process is running from — Windows keeps its image mapped — so the
swap there is Win32 `ReplaceFile` (through PowerShell's
`[System.IO.File]::Replace`), which moves the replaced binary aside to
`.talos.exe.old` instead of deleting it. That works while talos runs, and the
running process keeps its old image until the next launch, as on Unix. The swap
is one system call, so a talos killed or closed mid-update leaves the old
binary or the new one, never neither. The `.old` file is removed by the next
update, once nothing runs from it; updating again while a talos still does is
refused with nothing changed. Re-running `install.ps1` over a running talos
works the same way: it renames each installed binary to `.<name>.old` rather
than deleting it, and names the process to close when even that is refused.

**Auto-update never crosses a major version.** A 1.x install is told that 2.x
exists (the badge, and `talos-cli version --check`, both report it) and is
never moved onto it; it keeps updating along 1.x. This is not conservatism about
version numbers — 2.x replaced v1's compiled-in interface with the Lua plugin
kernel, so a silent crossing would hand someone a different program under the
same binary name. `talos-cli update --force` is the deliberate way across, and
the first v2 launch of a profile with v1 history still asks before anything
changes. The guard is `agent::version_check::crosses_major`, and it applies to
every future major too.

> Only a binary that *carries* the guard is protected by it. Releases up to
> v1.8.7 predate it, so an existing 1.8.x install with `auto_update = true` will
> still take 2.x on its next launch until a 1.x maintenance cut ships this
> commit. Until then, `auto_update = false` in `settings.toml` is the reliable
> hold — which is exactly what the v1→v2 consent gate writes when you decline.

`auto_update = true` also keeps **installed extensions** in step with the
binary. Extension versions are pinned to the binary's release tag, so an
extension only goes stale (`installed_with` ≠ the running binary) right after an
upgrade. The self-heal pass — which already runs on TUI startup and on the
headless `automation tick` — then refreshes each stale extension in place
(re-fetching it from its recorded source) instead of only nudging you to run
`talos-cli extension update`. The staleness check is local and network-free,
so a launch where nothing is stale does no extra work; a refresh runs at most
once per extension per binary version. With `auto_update` off, the nudge is
shown and you update extensions by hand.

### `[remote]` — sessions on hosts of hosts

A shareable host (see [hosts.toml](#hoststoml)) lists its own sessions and,
when it mirrors hosts of its own, theirs. `transitive_sessions` (default
`true`) keeps those: each session is listed once, on the most direct path this
instance has to it — a host reached directly wins over the same session seen
through another — and every action on it reaches the host that owns it. A row
seen through another host has no terminal attached here. `false` lists only
each host's own sessions and drops the rows already taken on, without deleting
anything anywhere. Read by every mirror pass, so a change applies on the next
one (within 10 s in the TUI). [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) → *Shared sessions*
has the rule.

### `[notifications]` — OS notification settings

Surfaces an OS notification when a session **transitions into a state
that needs your attention**. The trigger is the hooks-driven
[session status](#session-status) (reported by the agent's hooks, *not*
the terminal bell / output): the notification fires when a session crosses
into `Blocked` (the agent needs input or approval) and, with
`also_on_waiting = true`, also when it finishes a turn (`Working → Done`).
The edge is detected once per tick in `kernel::notify`, reading the same
`SessionState` the session-list status icon draws, so the banner can
never drift from the list (see `docs/FEATURES.md` → *Why the transition is
observed in one place*) — then deduped per session (`min_interval_secs`)
and skipped for the session you're currently viewing (`suppress_for_active`).
The notification body is the agent's last OSC 9 / OSC 777 message when
present (truncated to 200 chars), otherwise `Waiting for input` — the OSC
message is kept only for the body text, no longer for the trigger.
**Only fires while the TUI is open** — the dispatcher thread runs only
inside the TUI, so a headless `automation tick` never notifies.

**Delivery backend** (`backend`, default `auto`) is detected at startup:

| Backend | When | Click-to-focus |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `dbus` | normal Linux desktop with a running notification daemon (`org.freedesktop.Notifications`) | **yes** — clicking the banner writes a focus request the running TUI reads next tick and switches to that session |
| `windows` (toast) | **native Windows**, or **WSL** / any Linux with no dbus daemon — delivers a Windows toast via `powershell.exe` (WSL needs interop, on by default) | no (a Windows toast can't call back into the talos process) |
| `macos` | macOS native banner. Uses **`terminal-notifier`** when it's in `PATH` (own bundle + icon, looks like a real app notification — `brew install terminal-notifier`), otherwise the built-in **`osascript`** `display notification` (attributed to Apple's Script Editor). The `UNUserNotificationCenter` click API needs a signed `.app` bundle, which talos is not, so the `osascript` path is informational | **with `terminal-notifier`** — clicking the banner runs `talos-cli session focus <id>`, which writes the same metadata row the dbus path does and the TUI picks it up next tick. Without `terminal-notifier` (osascript fallback): no |

`auto` prefers `dbus` whenever a daemon answers, and only falls back to
the Windows toast when no dbus service is reachable. Force a specific
path or disable delivery with `backend = "dbus" | "windows" | "off"`
(`off` is a soft switch distinct from `[features] notifications`, which
stops the dispatcher thread entirely).

This auto-detection fixes a previously **silent failure** on WSL: the
dbus path errored on connect, but the only signal was a line in the
logfile, so the user saw nothing. Delivery errors are now recorded and
surfaced by the diagnostic:

```bash
talos-cli notify          # show the detected backend + last delivery error
talos-cli notify --test   # fire a sample notification to confirm it works
```

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `also_on_waiting` | `false` | also fire when a session finishes (`Working → Done`); the field name is historical |
| `suppress_for_active` | `true` | skip the notification for the session you're currently viewing |
| `sound` | `true` | play the OS default notification sound |
| `min_interval_secs` | `5` | per-session floor between two notifications (dedup) |
| `backend` | `auto` | delivery backend: `auto` \| `dbus` \| `windows` \| `off` |

Notifications fire on the hooks-driven status transitions (see
[Session status](#session-status)): always on `→ Blocked` (the agent needs
you), and with `also_on_waiting = true` also on `Working → Done`.

## Session status

Each session's state (Blocked / Working / Done / Idle) is driven by
**agent hooks** that call `talos-cli session signal --state
<working|blocked|done|idle>`. The state is persisted on the `sessions` row
(`hook_state`, `hook_state_at`, `seen_at` — schema v34) and survives the TUI
being closed; a hook fired headlessly is picked up via `PRAGMA data_version`.
Identity comes from the injected `TALOS_SESSION` env var, so a hook passes
no id. A finished turn shows `Done` (blue) — for the session you're watching too
— and becomes `Idle` once you switch focus off it.

The hooks are wired up automatically by the built-in **hooks** extension
(auto-activated on first run). Opt out with `talos-cli extension deactivate
hooks`. The status colours are tunable theme keys (`status_working` /
`status_blocked` / `status_done` / `status_idle` / `status_unreachable` /
`status_running` / `status_unknown` — see `themes.toml`). `status_running` is
an agent seen holding a pane that has reported nothing, and `status_unknown`
the two silences behind it (`uncovered`, `unreported`); both are spelled apart
from `status_idle`, which is the agent's own report that it is at rest.
`status_error` is a separate role, for a failed *command* in the list, not a
session state.

The wiring is applied **only to agents talos launches** — it never edits your
own global agent config (e.g. your personal `~/.claude/settings.json`). talos's
managed hook config lives per agent, applied by injecting a flag into
`agents.toml` or by a reversible merge into / managed file in the agent's own
config dir:

| Agent | On-disk location | How it's applied |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| claude | `~/.config/talos/hooks/claude.json` | `--settings` flag (claude merges it with your own settings) |
| aider | — (no file) | `--notifications-command` flag |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/plugin/talos-status.js` | managed plugin file |
| codex | `~/.codex/hooks.json` | reversible JSON-merge of talos's entries |
| vibe | `~/.vibe/hooks.toml` | managed file (refused if you already have one) |
| antigravity | `~/.gemini/settings.json` | reversible JSON-merge of talos's entries |

The home dir is `~/.config/talos/hooks` on a release build and
`~/.config/talos-dev/hooks` on a dev build. Because claude *merges* the
`--settings` file, your own hooks still fire inside a talos session — both run.
Hand-edits to a managed file are rewritten from the embedded payload on the next
TUI start / heartbeat tick; to customize, deactivate the extension and wire the
hook yourself, or edit the payload under `extensions/hooks/` and reinstall. Full
per-agent detail: `extensions/hooks/README.md`.

## themes.toml

User-defined themes, offered in the `Ctrl+Y` picker alongside the thirty-six
built-in presets and persisted by `name` like any preset. Each
`[[themes]]` entry starts from a built-in `base` and overrides only the
colours it names:

```toml
[[themes]]
name = "my-mocha"            # stable id; must not shadow a built-in
display_name = "My Mocha"    # picker label (default: name)
base = "catppuccin-mocha"    # starting palette (default: default)
accent = "#fab387"
app_bg = "reset"             # keep the terminal's native background
```

Colours accept anything ratatui parses: `#rrggbb`, ANSI names (`red`,
`lightcyan`), indexed (`14`), or `reset`. The seeded file lists every
overridable key — including the code-review diff colours `diff_added` /
`diff_removed` (added/removed line foreground) and `diff_added_bg` /
`diff_removed_bg` (the subtle full-row tint). Bad colours and built-in name
collisions degrade to startup warnings (the base colour / the built-in stays in
effect).

## keybindings.json

Maps `Action` names to one or more chord strings:

```json
{ "QuitApp": ["ctrl+a"], "OpenThemePicker": ["ctrl+y", "f4"] }
```

- Preferred editing path is the **F1 panel** (live capture, conflict
  stealing, immediate persistence). Hand-edits are read at startup.
- Chord syntax: `[ctrl+][alt+][shift+][cmd+]<key>` where `<key>` is a
  letter, `f1`–`f12`, or a named key (`enter`, `esc`, `tab`, arrows,
  `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `backspace`, `delete`,
  `insert`). Case-insensitive. `cmd` (aliases `super`, `command`,
  `win`) is the macOS Command key — delivered only by
  kitty-keyboard-protocol terminals (iTerm2 3.5+, kitty, WezTerm,
  Ghostty; not Terminal.app), and only for chords the emulator
  doesn't claim itself.
- Unknown action names, invalid chords, and the same chord bound to two
  actions in overlapping contexts are reported at startup (the file
  still loads; bad entries fall back to defaults).
- **Terminal passthrough.** When a session **terminal is focused**, the
  readline / shell line-editing chords (`Ctrl+A` start-of-line, `Ctrl+E`
  end-of-line, `Ctrl+W` delete-word, `Ctrl+U` kill-line, `Ctrl+R`
  reverse-search, `Ctrl+D` EOF, plus `Ctrl+B/F/O/P/S`) are **forwarded to the
  agent CLI** instead of triggering their talos command, so your terminal
  muscle memory works inside a session. Those talos commands stay reachable
  from the **session list** (focus it with `Ctrl+H`) and via their `F`-key
  alternates (`F2` info panel, `F3` file viewer, `F5` tasks). Rebinding such an
  action to a key that isn't a bare `Ctrl+<letter>` makes it work in the
  terminal too. Navigation/quit chords (`Ctrl+H/J/K/L`, `Ctrl+Q`, `Ctrl+N`) are
  **never** forwarded — they're how you leave the terminal.
- Action names and defaults: see the
  [Keybindings page](https://talos.zatzk.com/docs/keybindings.html), the
  live `F1` registry, or `src/session/keybindings.rs`.

## extensions/

Each opt-in extension is described by a single `extension.toml` manifest.
`talos-cli extension install` writes the home-resolved copy to
`~/.config/talos/extensions/<name>.toml` (talos never seeds this dir). The
install **home** (where payload files land and the session runs) defaults to
`~/.config/talos/extensions/<name>/` — a sibling dir of that manifest —
unless the manifest pins a `home` or you pass `--home`. The manifest has two
halves — an **install** spec and a **runtime** spec.

The example below is modelled on
[fleet](https://github.com/Thurbeen/fleet), the control-plane template that is
the worked example of an installable extension (`docs/ORCHESTRATION.md`). Its
real manifest uses `[[agents]]`, one `[[files]]`, three `[[symlinks]]` and one
`[[sessions]]`; the other entries here are illustrative, so every field the
format supports is shown once:

```toml
name = "fleet"
description = "Control-plane session: the repo map and talos orchestration"
config_version = 1              # manifest *format* version (for migrations)
version = "1.0.0"              # the extension's own version (bumped by its author)
min_talos_version = "2.19.0"  # minimum talos; older binaries get a warning
# home = "~/fleet"              # OPTIONAL; default is <config>/extensions/<name>.
                                # {home} is substituted everywhere it appears

# install spec ---------------------------------------------------------------
[[agents]]                      # registered in agents.toml (existing kept)
name = "fleet"
command = "claude"
args = ["--model", "claude-haiku-4-5"]

[[files]]                       # fetched from the source, written under home
path = "FLEET.md"
[[files]]
path = "scripts/sync-registry.sh"
executable = true               # chmod +x
[[files]]
path = "repos.md"
if_absent = true                # seed once; never clobbered on reinstall
[[files]]
path = ".claude/settings.json"
source = "claude-settings.json" # source path differs from dest
substitute = true               # replace {home} in the content

[[symlinks]]                    # never clobbers a real file at `link`
link = "CLAUDE.md"
target = "FLEET.md"

# Reaching OUTSIDE the extension home (used by the built-in hooks extension):
[[external_files]]              # write a file into an agent's OWN config dir
path = "~/.config/opencode/plugin/x.js"
source = "x.js"
requires_dir = "~/.config/opencode"  # skip when that agent isn't installed

[[agent_patches]]               # append args to an EXISTING agent (reversible)
name = "claude"
append_args = ["--settings", "{home}/claude.json"]

[[config_merges]]               # reversibly deep-merge into an agent's own
path = "~/.gemini/settings.json"  #   SHARED config file (never clobbered)
source = "antigravity-hooks.json"  # objects recurse, arrays union; uninstall prunes
requires_dir = "~/.gemini"      #   exactly our entries (by marker). no-op write
                                #   when unchanged; malformed target soft-skipped
# format = "toml"                # OPTIONAL; JSON by default. Set for a TOML
                                #   shared config (agent::toml_merge via toml_edit).
                                #   TOML owns its entries by a comment on each, so
                                #   the payload must stamp every one of them

# runtime spec (ensured on activate, self-healed if deleted) -----------------
[[sessions]]
name = "fleet"
agent = "fleet"
repo_path = "{home}"            # absolute, `~`-relative, or `{home}`; resolved
                                #   to an absolute path at install. `{home}` is
                                #   the extension home, so an extension whose
                                #   session must open the USER's checkout ships
                                #   a placeholder its installer renders instead

# [[automations]] is an OPTIONAL runtime resource (fleet ships none on purpose —
# its only scheduled candidate pushes to `main`). An extension that wants a
# scheduled tick declares:
[[automations]]
name = "example-tick"
trigger = "cron:*/10 * * * *"   # same grammar as `automation create --trigger`
session_ref = "fleet"          # must match a [[sessions]] name above
prompt = "tick"
```

Manage extensions with the CLI:

```bash
talos-cli extension install ./my-ext     # from a local dir: fetch + lay files
                                           #   + agents + activate
talos-cli extension install <url> --home ~/x    # from a URL, custom home
talos-cli extension install git+https://github.com/you/my-ext  # clone a repo
talos-cli extension uninstall <name>     # reverse install (keep home dir)
talos-cli extension uninstall <name> --purge    # also delete the home dir
talos-cli extension list                 # installed + active/healthy + version/stale
talos-cli extension update <name>        # re-fetch from recorded source (refresh)
talos-cli extension update --all         # update every installed extension
talos-cli extension update <name> --force # also overwrite user-edited seed files
talos-cli extension activate <name>      # (re)create resources + mark active
talos-cli extension deactivate <name>    # tear down + stop self-heal
talos-cli extension deactivate <name> --force --purge  # also kill tmux + drop manifest
talos-cli extension status [<name>]      # per-resource presence + version/stale
```

A bare name installs from the official source
(`raw.githubusercontent.com/zatzk/talos/<ref>/extensions/<name>`,
fetched via curl/wget) — `<ref>` is the running binary's release tag
(`main` for dev builds), so a fetched extension matches your binary.
**No extension ships under a bare name today**: `extensions/` holds only the
two built-ins (`hooks`, `ui-skill`), which are embedded in the binary and
activate themselves, so `extension available` lists nothing and every install
is a path, an `http(s)://` URL, or a repository (`git+https://…`, or a URL
ending in `.git`, or the scp-like `git@host:path` — recognised explicitly, so a
bare `https://` URL keeps meaning "a base to fetch files from"). Payload paths are
validated against traversal (no absolute paths or `..`), and a
`substitute` file you've edited isn't overwritten on reinstall (use
`--force`). Payload files are fetched as **text** (specs/scripts/JSON),
not binaries.

While an extension is **active**, talos **self-heals** its declared
resources: on TUI startup and on every `automation tick` it re-creates
any session/automation that has been deleted. So deleting them by hand is
a no-op (they come back); `extension deactivate` is the real off-switch.
Self-heal while the TUI is closed depends on the automation heartbeat
(`[features] automations = true`); with automations off, healing happens
at the next TUI startup only.

### Versioning + the update lifecycle

Extensions carry two version markers, and the installer stamps two more
into the discovery-dir copy so staleness can be detected:

| Field | Where set | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `version` | source manifest | the extension's own semver (author-bumped) |
| `min_talos_version` | source manifest | minimum talos; older binaries warn |
| `installed_with` | stamped on install | the talos version that installed it |
| `source` | stamped on install | the target it was installed from |

A **bare-name** install (`extension install <name>`) fetches from the
official source **pinned to the running binary's release tag**, so the
extension you get always matches your talos. When you later **upgrade
talos**, the on-disk copy is now older than the binary — talos
flags it as `stale` (in `extension list`/`status`, and as a one-line
nudge from self-heal at startup). Run `extension update <name>` (or
`--all`) to re-fetch from the recorded `source`; because a bare name
re-resolves against the *new* binary's tag, this pulls the version that
matches your upgraded talos. Updates honour the same file rules as
install — user-edited `substitute` files and `if_absent` seeds are
preserved unless you pass `--force`.

`min_talos_version` is a **soft** gate: an extension authored for a
newer talos still installs on an older binary, but install/activate and
self-heal emit a compatibility warning so the mismatch is visible.
**Dev builds** (`0.0.0-dev`) skip both the staleness and compatibility
checks — their version doesn't order against release tags.

**Rollback.** There's no version snapshot store: to roll an extension
back, install from a URL or repository that names the version you want —
for a bare-name extension that is a specific talos tag, `extension install
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zatzk/talos/v0.112.0/extensions/<name>`
— or downgrade the binary and run `extension update`, which re-resolves
the bare name to that older tag.

## SQLite-backed settings

Live in the `metadata` table and apply immediately (no restart):

| Key | Set via | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `active_theme` | `Ctrl+Y` / `F4` picker | TUI palette (fifteen built-ins) |
| `editor_command` | `talos-cli editor set "<cmd>"` | what `Ctrl+O` runs |
| `editor_mode` | `talos-cli editor mode <auto\|terminal\|gui>` | how `Ctrl+O` runs the editor: `auto` (default) detects terminal vs GUI and gives terminal editors a real TTY (tmux popup / TUI suspend); `terminal` forces the TTY path; `gui` forces detached |
| `active_extensions` | `talos-cli extension activate/deactivate` | JSON array of active extensions to self-heal |
| `builtin_hooks_optout` | `talos-cli extension deactivate hooks` | `1` when the user opted out of the auto-activated hooks extension |
| `perf_snapshot` | the TUI, while perf timing is active (`TALOS_PERF_LOG` or an open perf HUD) | JSON perf snapshot read by `talos-cli perf` (see `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`) |
| `host_probe_backoff:<backend>` | the teardown sweep, when a host's windows could not be listed | `<attempted_at_millis>:<failures>` — how long that host is left alone before the sweep asks again (ADR-26). Not user-set; the row is deleted the first time the host answers |
| `session_reap_backoff:<session id>` | the teardown sweep, when a soft-deleted row's reap did not reach its host | `<attempted_at_millis>:<failures>` — the same curve, per row rather than per host, for a host that answers `list-windows` while its own `talos-cli` does not run (ADR-26). Not user-set; the row is deleted the moment the reap comes off, and by a restore, which ends the delete it belonged to |
| `session_name_claim:<backend>:<name>` | a creator holding a session name while it spawns — extension self-heal today | `<expires_at_millis>` — the claim that stops two unattended creators both deciding one name is free (issue #1192). Not user-set; deleted when the creation finishes, and taken over once it expires |

These are in the DB rather than a file because they are written
concurrently by multiple talos processes (TUI, CLI, MCP) and picked
up live via `PRAGMA data_version` polling.

## Environment variables

User-set (read by talos):

| Variable | Used for |
|----------|----------|
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME` | config/data roots |
| `VISUAL`, then `EDITOR` | `Ctrl+O` editor when `editor_command` is unset |
| `SHELL` | the `Ctrl+T` companion shell pane (fallback `/bin/sh`). For a remote/WSL session the pane uses the **host's** `$SHELL` as an interactive login shell (the SSH-login environment), not the local one. |
| `RUST_LOG` | log filter for `talos.log` |
| `TALOS_PERF_LOG` | opt-in performance logging: a one-shot `startup` phase breakdown at first paint, per-session `restore_adopt`/`adopt_split` lines, steady-state `perf_window` lines (~10 s cadence), and wall-clock frame/tick timing collection. Any value enables it. See `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`. |
| `TALOS_SOCKET` | overrides the **local** multiplexer socket name, winning over the data-dir derivation below. For test/sandbox tooling: Unix scoping uses `TMUX_TMPDIR`, but psmux (Windows) resolves every `-L <name>` machine-wide, so this is the only way to fully scope an instance there. Remote hosts are unaffected (socket from `hosts.toml`). Empty = unset. |
| `TALOS_UI_INSTANCE` | selects a running TUI for `talos-cli ui state` and `ui action` when `--instance` is omitted. |
| `WSL_DISTRO_NAME` | set by WSL itself, not by you: it is how talos knows which distro it is running inside. That distro is *this machine*, so it is never offered as a host and a `hosts.toml` entry pointing at it is ignored — see [hosts.toml](#hoststoml) |

Set **by** talos into every spawned agent process (not user-set;
`session_ops::inject_talos_env` / `App::build_spawn_inputs`). An
agent — or a `talos-cli` call running inside the session — reads
these to prove its own identity without scraping panes or names:

| Variable | Set into agent process |
|----------|------------------------|
| `TALOS_SESSION` | the stable talos `SessionId` (the registry key); read back by `talos-cli message`/`inbox` for self-identity, and by `session signal` — see below |
| `TALOS_SESSION_ID` | the agent's own conversation id (`agent_session_id`); consumed by the metrics statusline. Distinct from `TALOS_SESSION` |
| `TALOS_TASK` | the originating task id; task-spawned sessions only (headless `task run`) |
| `TALOS_METRICS_DIR` | metrics output dir |
| `TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` / `TALOS_DATA_DIR` | the resolved config/data dirs, so the agent's `talos-cli` (its status hook) targets the same DB the TUI reads — independent of XDG, which `talos-cli` is on PATH, or a stale tmux-server env. Also honored if you set them yourself to relocate talos's state. |
| `TALOS_SOCKET` | the multiplexer socket that instance's sessions live on, so an in-session `talos-cli` reaches the same server instead of re-deriving one from the session's own environment |
| `TALOS_SOCKET_FOR` | the data dir that injected `TALOS_SOCKET` belongs to. Read only to tell an inherited socket from one you exported: a child that points `TALOS_DATA_DIR` somewhere else no longer matches, and derives its own socket instead of creating windows on the spawning instance's server |

A pane's **`PATH`** is the `PATH` of the talos that spawned it, which tmux
copies in by itself. talos adds one thing to it: the directory holding its own
`talos-cli`, in front, prepended and never replacing what was there. Without
it a session spawned by a `talos-cli` running over ssh — which on a
shared-sessions host is every session, since the local TUI delegates
`session create` to the host's CLI — inherits sshd's `PATH` for a
non-interactive command (`/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games`), which has
no `~/.local/bin` on it. The bare `talos-cli` the status hooks call then
resolves to nothing and the `|| true` after it hides that. It arrives as an
`env PATH=…` prefix on the window command rather than as one more injected
variable, because `PATH` is the one tmux will not take that way: both
`new-window -e PATH=…` and `set-environment -g PATH …` are ignored (verified
against tmux 3.5a).

`TALOS_SESSION` is a **stable integration contract**, not an internal
detail of the hooks extension. It is set on the pane, so every process
started inside it inherits it — including an agent a driver of your own
launches there, and that agent's own hooks. Anything in the pane can
therefore report state with

```bash
talos-cli session signal --state <working|blocked|done|idle>
```

and no arguments at all; from outside the pane, pass `--session <uuid>`.
That is the supported way to give talos agent state for a session it
did not wire — for instance one created with a bare interactive shell as
its "agent" because a harness owns the real launch.

Two caveats. A **remote** session's `talos-cli` writes the *host's*
database: on a shared host (`share_sessions = true`, the default) that is
correct and the observer mirrors it, but on a non-shared host the signal
never reaches the local database — talos rewrites its own hooks to a
tmux pane option there for exactly this reason. And every shipped hook
command ends in `|| true`, so a failed signal is silent; `talos-cli
session doctor` is how to check the wiring.

Set **by** talos into every [lifecycle hook](#hookstoml) it runs
(`session_ops::lifecycle_hooks`), beside `TALOS_SESSION`,
`TALOS_SESSION_ID`, `TALOS_TASK` and the location overrides above:

| Variable | Set into hook process |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `TALOS_HOOK_EVENT` | the event, e.g. `session.pre_delete` |
| `TALOS_SESSION_NAME`, `TALOS_AGENT` | the session's name and agent |
| `TALOS_REPO`, `TALOS_CWD` | the primary repository, and the directory the agent runs in |
| `TALOS_BRANCH`, `TALOS_BASE_BRANCH` | the worktree branch and its base |
| `TALOS_HOST` | the remote host name (local: unset) |
| `TALOS_PARENT_SESSION` | the parent session id |

Set **at build time** (not runtime):

| Variable | Used for |
|----------|----------|
| `TALOS_RELEASE_VERSION` | read by `build.rs` to inject the binary version at build (CI release workflow sets it, e.g. `v1.0.0`); absent → falls back to `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` |

Editor resolution order: DB `editor_command` → `$VISUAL` → `$EDITOR` →
error toast.

### Relocating an instance (`TALOS_DATA_DIR`)

`TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` and `TALOS_DATA_DIR` move talos's config and its
database. Because the database *is* the record of which sessions exist, an
instance whose data dir has moved also gets a **multiplexer socket of its own**
— `talos-<digest of the data dir>` (`talos-dev-…` on a dev build) — instead
of creating its windows on the server holding your everyday sessions. That is
what makes a scratch instance safe to run a real `session create` in, and it is
also why its `automation-heartbeat` window is reclaimable: killing that
instance's server (`tmux -L "$(talos-cli version --json | jq -r .tmux_socket)"
kill-server`) takes the whole instance with it and touches nothing else.

Three rules keep the ordinary case ordinary:

- **The default instance never moves.** It stays on `talos`
  (`talos-dev` for a dev build), including when `TALOS_DATA_DIR` merely
  restates the default — which is exactly what talos injects into every
  session it spawns.
- **A relocated *config* dir alone changes nothing.** It shares the default
  instance's database, and therefore its sessions and their server.
- **`TALOS_SOCKET` wins over both**, so anything that needs the socket *by
  name* (the dev sandbox, whose teardown kills it) keeps naming it — **unless it
  was inherited from another instance.** talos injects the socket into every
  pane it spawns, paired with `TALOS_SOCKET_FOR`, the data dir it belongs to.
  A `talos-cli` inside that pane which relocates *itself* — a sandbox, a test
  harness, an agent exporting its own `TALOS_DATA_DIR` — no longer matches
  that pairing, so the inherited name is dropped and the derivation runs. An
  override you export yourself carries no pairing and still wins outright.
  Without this, isolating the database silently left the tmux server shared,
  which looks contained and is not.

Ask a build which server it is on rather than assuming: `talos-cli version
--json` reports the socket in force as `tmux_socket`, and `talos-cli config
show` prints it under `Sessions`.

`session create --json` reports `tmux_socket` too, as the socket of the server
the new session's pane is on: the host's for a `--host` session (its `socket`
in `hosts.toml`, else what its own CLI reported), this instance's for a local
one, and `null` for a row on a host `hosts.toml` no longer describes. Hand it
to `tmux -L` together with `backend_id`, which is the pane id.

The key keeps the name `tmux_socket` on every platform, including native
Windows where psmux serves it. It is public JSON that scripts already read, and
it is the `-L` name every tmux-protocol multiplexer takes. A rename would break
those scripts for no new information, so there is no alias. A multiplexer that
is not addressed by `-L` would have to add its own key rather than reuse this
one.

**An instance relocated before this existed is a new instance.** Its old
sessions are still on the default server, and its database still lists them —
on the new socket they read as sessions whose window is gone. There is no
migration: point that instance back at the old server with
`TALOS_SOCKET=talos` if you want them, or let it create fresh ones.

### Several instances on one server

Two talos instances that share a server — the same data dir on one machine,
or a lead over ssh and one locally — show the same sessions, and a pane can be
only one size. There is **no setting** for this: the instance you type into
sizes the pane, and the others show its screen as it is, with blank margins or
cropped to its bottom rows, and say so on the pane's bottom row (`120×41 · sized
by another talos · type here to resize`). Focusing a pane there, or typing into
it, hands the size over; when the sizing instance goes, the one left takes its own size back.
The name of the instance sizing a window is the window option `@talos_sizer`
(`tmux -L <socket> show-options -w -t <pane> @talos_sizer`). Why it works
this way, and what it costs, is ADR-27 in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. On a Windows
host (psmux) the last instance to paint a pane still sizes it.

## Local UI control

Every running TUI advertises a random instance ID under its data profile's
`ui-control/` directory. Run `talos-cli ui instances --json` to list reachable
screens with their PID, local/SSH label and terminal hint.
`talos-cli ui --instance <id> state --json` reports the focused pane,
selected session ID, arranged slots with rects and visible panes, panel state, kernel modal and its
selection, open plugin floats, active search query and result selection, and
the action catalog revision. Plugin-owned details are limited to each plugin's
optional `ui_state()` projection of small scalar values; the Lua store and
terminal contents are never copied into this snapshot. `plugin_state` keys
projections by plugin file path, so two panes with the same display name remain
distinct. If a combined snapshot exceeds the local reply limit, the command
returns an explicit `state_too_large` error. A command
without `--instance` uses the sole reachable screen, or refuses with an
ambiguity error listing IDs when several are running. `TALOS_UI_INSTANCE`
selects a default for scripts. Closed or crashed screens cannot be targeted;
stale discovery records are removed when discovered.

`talos-cli ui --instance <id> watch --json` writes an initial snapshot and
then JSON lines for changes to focus, layout, overlays, selection, search, and
action outcomes. `--since <revision>` resumes after a known revision. The
per-instance buffer holds 256 deltas; an expired or future cursor yields a
`resync_required` response containing a fresh snapshot. `--once` returns one batch as
a JSON document for polling callers. This stream is UI state only;
`talos-cli watch` continues to stream durable session events.

List the target's live actions and their argument types, ownership, effect,
destructive classification, availability and current chords with
`talos-cli ui --instance <id> actions --json`. `talos-cli schema --instance
<id> --json` includes those same descriptors beside the CLI command tree.
Both read the running interface, so reloading a plugin updates them together.
When no TUI is running, `schema` marks its UI portion `no_running_ui` and still
lists headless CLI commands. With several running TUIs, select one explicitly.
The two initial typed actions are:

```sh
talos-cli ui --instance <id> action session.focus --session <session-uuid> --json
talos-cli ui --instance <id> action search.open --query 'error handling' --json
```

`session.focus` requires a session visible to the target TUI and a focusable
agent pane. `search.open`
opens the strip and sets its query; calling it again replaces the query without
closing the strip. The reply comes from the target's event loop after it applies
or refuses the action. The older `session focus` command still uses its shared
notification request and does not select a TUI instance.

Any non-destructive declared action can be called by its catalog name. Use
`--arg name=value` for an argument; `--session` and `--query` remain shortcuts
for the first two actions. A destructive action needs an explicit session UUID.
Its first request exits with a structured `confirmation_required` result and an
opaque `result.error.ticket`; it changes nothing. Run `talos-cli ui --instance
<id> confirm <ticket> --json` as a separate step. A ticket expires after 30
seconds, works once for the same local peer and instance, and is refused if
the action catalog or target changes. A confirmation queues the normal session
operation; its later success or failure is reported through the ordinary TUI
command status. An addressed destructive key cannot bypass this step.
For input owned by an active modal or plugin, use addressed operations such as
`talos-cli ui --instance <id> input modal --key esc`,
`input search --input-text 'term'`, or `input agent --scroll down`. These operations
refuse an inactive target. Keys and text are refused for session terminals;
agent terminal bytes stay on the session input path.

The local control audit lives at `ui-control/audit.jsonl` in the data profile.
It is owner-only and bounded to roughly 1 MiB. It records time, instance,
peer, action ID, target session ID, outcome and request ID for external action
attempts and decisions. It omits arguments such as search queries, addressed
input, terminal text and secrets. If audit storage is unavailable, destructive
control refuses before dispatch. A bounded worker queue writes the records;
destructive requests wait for its result with a short deadline. A file lock
keeps rollover and append together across running instances.

The `ui actions` descriptor schema is versioned separately from the CLI. For
schema version 1, bundled action names, argument names and meanings remain
stable; new optional fields and new actions can appear. Clients should ignore
unknown fields and rediscover the live catalog after `catalog_revision` moves.
Plugin-owned actions and `plugin_state` projections are governed by their
plugins and may disappear on reload. `ui state` exposes the active search query,
so scripts should treat its output and the event stream as private even though
terminal contents are omitted. No `ui capture` command is provided: visible
terminal cells can contain credentials or private prompts, and bounded output
alone would not make a useful redaction boundary.

The control channel is a Unix socket in a user-owned `0700` directory with a
peer UID check, or a local Windows named pipe with a current-user ACL and remote
clients rejected. Requests are length-framed JSON, limited to 16 KiB requests
and 256 KiB replies, with a
bounded queue; each client has a two-second deadline. The interface does not
listen on TCP. A CLI on another machine must be run on the TUI's host.
If the local endpoint cannot start, the TUI still runs and shows a notice after
other startup notices;
`ui instances` will not list it.

## Versioning

The SQLite schema migrates automatically (`schema_version` in
`metadata`). The TOML files carry a `config_version = 1` marker so a
future format change can migrate them too; current files are version 1
and the field is optional.

`schema_version` records what *ran*, which is not the same as what is *there*,
and the two came apart: migrations were originally written as
`let _ = conn.execute("ALTER …")`, which swallowed a real failure while the
version advanced anyway. One database in the field reported the current version
with none of v41's four columns on `sessions`, so every status signal failed
with `no such column: stopped_at` and no session on that machine ever reported
a state. The version gate could not repair it — the version was the thing that
was wrong — so the **additive** steps — those that add a column or a table of
their own if absent — are now re-asserted on **every open**, not only on an
upgrade. A healthy database changes nothing and pays a handful of catalogue
reads. Steps that rewrite or seed data stay gated on the version, because
applying one twice does not mean what applying it once meant.
