# Orchestration: the control-plane pattern

Design rationale for running agent sessions across more than one repo.
For the primitives themselves, see [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md); for how
they are built, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## The problem

One repo, one agent session, one task: nothing to orchestrate. The repo
holds the code, the session holds the context, and the pull request is
the record of what happened.

At N repos this breaks in a specific place. The work still lands in the
repos — that part is fine — but the *plan* has nowhere to live. A goal
that spans three repos is not a file in any of them. Neither is the
context that makes the goal legible: what each project is for, which
ones depend on each other, which are dormant. Neither is the log of what
you actually launched last Tuesday and what came back.

In practice that state ends up in a chat transcript, which is not
durable, not diffable, and not readable by the next session. The
question is not "how do I run agents in parallel" — talos already does
that. It is **where does the plan live, and what reads it?**

---

## The control plane

Give the plan its own repo. A **control plane** is a repo that holds two
things and nothing else:

- **The map.** An always-current index of your repos (`registry/`),
  generated from the GitHub API so it cannot drift, plus hand-written
  context files (`registry/context/<repo>.md`) holding the judgement a
  generated index can't: what a project is *for*, how it relates to the
  others, what its current goals are.
- **The orchestration.** Reusable recipes
  (`orchestration/playbooks/<name>.md`) and one log per run
  (`orchestration/runs/<date>-<slug>.md`).

The defining rule is what the control plane *doesn't* hold:

> **The control plane holds the plan and the log. It never holds the
> workers' branches.**

Each unit of work becomes one talos worker session, targeting a real
repo in its own git worktree, driven by a single self-contained prompt.
Workers share no context with the control plane and none with each
other, so every prompt restates the goal, the constraints, and what
"done" means, from scratch.

**Why split generated from hand-written?** They have different failure
modes. An index of repo names, default branches, and archived flags goes
stale the moment you rename something, so it must be regenerated and
never hand-edited. Why a project exists cannot be generated at all, and
it changes on a human timescale. Storing them in one file guarantees
that regenerating the half that must be fresh destroys the half that
must be preserved.

**Why a separate repo?** Because the plan outlives every branch it
spawns. A run log in one of the worker repos would be a foreign artifact
there, would collide with the very branches it describes, and would go
looking for a home the moment the run touches a second repo. Separating
them also makes the invariant enforceable rather than aspirational: if
the control plane has no worktrees, work cannot accidentally happen in
it.

---

## The run loop

1. Clarify the goal. Pick a playbook, or write one from the template.
2. Open a run log, named `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`.
3. For each unit of work, launch a worker session with one
   self-contained prompt, in its own worktree on the target repo.
4. Record every session — name, repo, prompt intent, outcome, PR — in
   the run log **as it happens**, not at the end. A run log written
   afterwards is a summary; one written during is the source of truth
   for what happened, and it survives the lead session dying.
5. Drain results from the mailbox as workers report.
6. Review the PRs. Delete each session as it closes out.

---

## Why this is a talos pattern

The shape above isn't invented; it's what falls out of talos's
primitives once you use them at more than one repo. Each piece is doing
load-bearing work.

### Worktree-per-session

A worker session creates a git worktree on its own branch
(`--worktree-branch`). Two workers on the same repo cannot collide, and
an abandoned worker costs you a directory, not a dirty checkout on a
branch someone else needs. This is what makes "one unit of work, one
session" safe to say — without it, parallelism across a shared checkout
is a merge conflict waiting for a scheduler.

### The lead is a real session

The control plane installs itself as an extension with one long-lived
`[[sessions]]` entry (ADR-21). Two properties follow, and the pattern
needs both.

It **self-heals**: active extensions are recorded in SQLite and their
sessions are recreated at TUI startup and on every `automation tick`.
Delete the lead session and it comes back. A control plane that
evaporates when someone tidies up their session list is not a control
plane.

And because it *is* a real session rather than an ad-hoc terminal, it
can be addressed. Workers can mail it. It has a UUID to hand out as
`--parent`. It gets `TALOS_SESSION` in its environment like any other
session. The lead being a first-class session is the precondition for
everything in the next two sections.

### The mailbox, not polling

Workers report by mailing the lead:

```sh
talos-cli message send --to <lead> --kind result --body '<PR url>'
```

The lead drains its inbox exactly once:

```sh
talos-cli message inbox --for <lead> --claim --json
```

`send` **wakes** the recipient by default, so the lead never polls.
talos injects `TALOS_SESSION` into each session's environment, and
both `--from` and `inbox --for` default to it, so a worker needs no ids
to mail home and the lead needs none to read its own mail.

**Why not poll `gh pr list`?** Three reasons, and the third is the one
that matters:

- It is **exact**. A message is addressed to the lead by a worker that
  knows it finished. A PR query infers completion from a side effect.
- It is **immediate**. `send` wakes the lead; a poll runs on its own
  cadence and adds latency proportional to the interval.
- It can say **"not applicable"**. A worker that correctly concludes
  there was nothing to do reports that in one message. A PR poll cannot
  distinguish "no PR because there was nothing to fix" from "no PR
  because the worker is still thinking" — and those demand opposite
  responses from the lead.

`--kind` is a free-form tag, so a run can distinguish `result` from
`questions` or `plan` without the lead parsing prose.

### `watch`, for everything that is not a report

The mailbox is how a worker says it finished. `talos-cli watch` is how a
driver learns everything the worker was never going to mail — that it went
blocked on a permission, that its pane died, that somebody deleted it:

```sh
talos-cli watch --json --initial | while read -r line; do …; done
```

It streams an **append-only log**, not a sampled diff. Every writer that
changes what a watcher reports appends its event in the same transaction as the
change, so two transitions in the same instant are two events. That is not a
detail: `working → blocked → working` is what an auto-answered permission looks
like, and a sampler that reads the row every 250 ms sees neither edge.

Each line carries a `seq` (monotonic, never reused), the `event`
(`present`/`created`/`changed`/`gone`), a `reason` saying which kind it was —
`spawned`/`registered`/`restored`, `state`/`stopped`/`started`/`updated`,
`soft_deleted`/`force_deleted`/`forgotten` — the `from_state` → `to_state` of the
transition, and the same gating fields the table above lists, so acting on a
`blocked` needs no follow-up `session get`. `hook_state_contradicted` is `null`
(not checked) unless you pass `--verify`.

A driver that persists the last `seq` it handled restarts with
`--since <seq>` and gets exactly what it missed. `--session` narrows the stream
to one session, `--for-secs` bounds it, and it exits the moment its reader
closes the pipe.

`gone` used to be one word for both deletes. It is now two, and the difference
is the one that matters to a driver: `soft_deleted` can be restored,
`force_deleted` had its worktrees and window torn down. A third, `forgotten`,
touched nothing at all: a session mirrored through another host left this
instance's list (`[remote] transitive_sessions = false`) and goes on running at
its owner.

### `--parent`

Spawn workers with `--parent "$TALOS_SESSION"` and the lead/worker
tree is recorded rather than remembered. `session list --parent <uuid>
--json` enumerates a run's workers afterwards — including the ones that
never reported, which are exactly the ones you need to find.

### Deliberately no automations

talos has `[[automations]]` (ADR-8b), and this pattern does not use
them.

The one scheduled candidate is the registry sync. It regenerates the
index from the GitHub API, then commits and pushes. That is a write to
`main` on a cadence, with no reader — so a human runs it and reads the
diff. Nothing else in the pattern is periodic: a run starts because
someone has a goal.

Restraint here is part of the pattern, not an omission from it. A
control plane that fires unattended writes is a second actor in the
system, and the whole point of the run log is that there is one.

---

## Constraints worth stating

Five facts shape any headless orchestration built on talos. Each
costs real time to rediscover.

### The status field is not a completion signal

`session get`/`list --json` **do** carry the `working`/`blocked`/`done`/
`idle` state that agent hooks report through `session signal`, in
`hook_state`. What they cannot carry is any guarantee that it is
*current*: `hook_state` is latched — whatever was written last, by an
agent that may since have crashed, been interrupted, or never have been
wired to report at all. Polling it for completion is how a lead waits
forever on a worker that finished an hour ago, or declares one done
because its agent was never instrumented in the first place.

So headless completion detection is still the **mailbox**, or a printed
sentinel the lead greps out of `session capture`. What the state fields
are for is *supervision* — noticing that a worker is stuck, blocked, or
gone — and each one comes with what it takes to judge it:

| field | what it answers |
|---|---|
| `hook_state` | the raw last report, unchanged and unfiltered |
| `hook_state_at`, `hook_state_age_secs` | when it was made, and how long ago |
| `hook_reported` | whether anything has *ever* reported (silence ≠ idle) |
| `hook_coverage`, `hook_states_reportable` | what this agent can report at all |
| `hook_coverage_source` | which name that answer came from: `name`, `hook_schema`, or `detection` (the pane, for a row that declares no agent — coverage then reads `presumed`, never `full`) |
| `hook_blocked_is_heuristic` | whether its `blocked` is a text match on a notification body |
| `hook_corroboration`, `hook_state_contradicted` | what actually holds the pane, and whether it agrees |
| `detected_agent` | which registered agent is in the pane, when it is not the row's own |
| `state`, `state_source` | the best answer available, and where it came from |
| `stopped` | whether the session is parked — `session stop`, no pane |
| `reports_as` | the agent the hook fields were read against, when a driver declared one |

`state` is always a word, and one of `SessionState`'s — the single
vocabulary `session get`, `session list`, `talos-cli watch` and the
interface all derive through, so no two of them answer differently for
one row. Besides the four an agent can signal it can read `unreported`
(nothing has reported for this session), `uncovered` (its agent is wired
to report nothing), `stopped` (the session is parked) or `running` (an
agent holds the pane and has not signalled — `session get`'s probe only).
None of those four is a state an agent can signal, and `state_source` is
null for the first three. The piped (TOON) `session list` shows this
column, and so does the interface — its session list derives through the
same `Assessment`, so a driver reconciling the screen with a `session
get` never has to reconcile two vocabularies.

`agent`, `reports_as` and `detected_agent` are three different facts and
no two of them substitute for each other: what the row was created as,
what a driver *declared* it runs, and what is observably in the pane
right now. Detection is deliberately never written back as `reports_as`
— a declaration is durable, an observation is not, and deriving one from
the other would make a passing process permanent.

A finished turn reads `done` until somebody looks at it and `idle`
after: the interface stamps `seen_at` when focus moves off, and every
read verb folds that in. It is a stored fact, not a guessed timeout —
the two folds that *are* timing (a `working` session gone quiet, an
unreachable host) need a live terminal, so headless answers never
invent them.

A **parked** session (`session stop`: pane killed, row and checkout
kept) stays in `session list` and is told apart there — `stopped: true`
and `state: "stopped"` on both read verbs, so a liveness check is the
poll you were already doing rather than a pane probe. Its `backend_id`
still names the window it had: that is what the row records, and
`session start` replaces it with the new pane's id. `send`, `key` and
`capture` refuse a parked session by name instead of reaching for the
window that is gone.

Parking also **clears the latched state and refuses a new one**. A parked
session has no process, so a heartbeat's pane-option poll or a mirror pass
carrying a host's last word would be reporting a turn on a session that cannot
be in one — and every watcher of that row would see a transition that did not
happen. `session signal` against a parked session fails rather than silently
doing nothing, and says to `session start` it first.

There is deliberately **no staleness timeout**. A turn may legitimately
run for an hour, so any bound talos picked would report live work as
finished; the age is published instead and the policy is yours.

`session get` checks the pane by default (one multiplexer query plus one
`ps`); `session list` does not unless you pass `--verify`, since that
cost is per session. A remote session answers `unavailable` — its pane
lives on its own host's multiplexer. `talos-cli session doctor` is the
same information as a verdict, plus whether the wiring is installed at
all; it exits non-zero when a session's wiring is broken. An agent
talos ships no hooks for but which is signalling anyway — a driver
calling `session signal` itself — is a warning, not a failure, and a
`--command` session is "no hooks expected": talos never had an agent
there to wire, so there is nothing to find broken.

If your driver launches an agent *inside* such a session, say so with
`session create --reports-as <agent>` or `session reports-as <ref>
<agent>`. Every field in the table is then read against that agent
instead of the command's file stem — including
`hook_blocked_is_heuristic`, which otherwise reports `false` for a pane
running claude and tells a supervisor the block signal is structured
when it is a text match on a notification body.

`session capture --json` adds the pane's live state alongside its text —
`cursor_row`/`cursor_col`, `foreground_process` and `foreground_command`,
`foreground_cwd` — which is what a lead reading a worker's screen needs
to tell "waiting at a prompt" from "still printing", and which agent CLI
is actually in the foreground.

### A driver that launches its own agent can still report state

talos wires status hooks at launch, for an agent it knows from
`agents.toml`. A harness that must own the agent launch itself — asking
talos for a bare interactive shell and starting the agent inside that
pane — therefore gets no hooks, and its sessions would read as never
having reported anything.

Three things close that, and all are **stable contract**:

- **`talos-cli agent launch-args <name>` reports what to launch.**
  The hooks are *arguments* — the `hooks` extension installs them by
  appending to the agent's `args` in `agents.toml` (`--settings
  <hooks>.json` for claude) — so an agent started any other way simply
  has none. This prints the `command`, `args` and `env` talos itself
  would use; pass the args through and the hooks are there. With
  `--session <ref>` it resolves for that session: the conversation id is
  pinned to the row's, the host adapts the args, and the environment
  carries the `TALOS_SESSION` its `session signal` will report under.
- **`TALOS_SESSION` is in the pane's environment**, and every child
  process inherits it. So anything running in the pane — the driver, the
  agent, one of the agent's own hooks — can call
  `talos-cli session signal --state <working|blocked|done|idle>` with
  **no arguments**: identity resolves from the environment. From outside
  the pane, pass `--session <uuid>`. This is the supported way to report
  state for an agent talos did not launch. `session exec` carries the
  *target* session's identity, not the calling driver's, so a signal run
  through it lands on the session it names.
- **Failing that, the pane is read anyway.** A session that never
  signalled but whose pane's foreground process is an agent the registry
  knows reports `state: "running"` with `state_source: "process"` and
  `hook_corroboration: "foreign-agent"`. It is coarser than a hook by
  design — process inspection can say an agent is there, never what it
  is doing — but it is the difference between a session that reads as
  empty and one that reads as alive.

### Read the exit status before parsing the output

Errors are **structured documents on stdout**, not lines on stderr —
AXI principle 6, because an agent reads one stream and a message on
stderr is one it has to be told to capture. The exit code carries the
verdict: `0` success, `1` the command ran and failed, `2` the invocation
was wrong, `3` a session reference matched more than one session.

The consequence is a trap worth naming. `talos-cli … --json | jq -r
'.field'` exits **0 with empty output** when the command failed: `jq`
parsed the error object perfectly well, found no such field, and the
pipeline reports `jq`'s status rather than talos's. Capture first and
branch on the status, or read `.error`:

```bash
out=$(talos-cli session get "$ref" --json) || {
  printf 'talos: %s\n' "$(jq -r .error <<<"$out")" >&2
  exit 1
}
id=$(jq -r .id <<<"$out")
```

`set -o pipefail` does not help here — the failing command exits 1 but
`jq` succeeds, so the pipeline's status is `jq`'s either way.

### The environment `session exec` runs under

`session exec <ref> -- <cmd>` runs in the session's directory, on the
machine it lives on, and under the session's own environment: whatever
`session create --env` recorded for it, plus the `TALOS_*` identity
its pane carries. The calling process's own `TALOS_*` variables are
**scrubbed** — a driver running inside one session must not lend the
child that session's identity, which is what made
`session exec <worker> -- talos-cli session signal --state done`
record for the *driver* and exit 0. The environment actually used is in
the result's `env`.

### Fast-forward the base branch before creating a worktree

A worktree inherits whatever the *local* base branch points at, not what
the remote does. A stale local `main` yields a worker that does
perfectly correct work against a month-old tree and opens a conflicting
PR — a failure that looks like a bad agent and is really a bad base.

Fetch and fast-forward before `session create`, and verify
`git rev-list --count main..origin/main` is `0`.

## The reference implementation

Everything above, as a public GitHub template: **the `fleet` repository**,
<https://github.com/Thurbeen/fleet>. It is also the worked example of a
talos extension — the one the rest of the documentation points at, since
`extensions/` in the talos repo holds only the two built-ins.

```text
registry/
  owners.example.txt         copy to owners.txt; GitHub owners to index
  repos.generated.yaml       generated and gitignored; never hand-edited
  context/_TEMPLATE.md       copy this to add a project
orchestration/
  playbooks/_TEMPLATE.md     copy this to add a recipe
  runs/_TEMPLATE.md          copy this per run
  session-profiles.yaml      the session shapes a run may ask for
scripts/
  sync-registry.sh           regenerate the index via `gh`
  sync-checkout.sh           fast-forward main when that is safe
  install-extension.sh       render extension.toml, then install
  update-from-template.sh    pull the template's changes into your clone
extension.toml.in            manifest template (rendered at install time)
FLEET.md                     standing context for the long-lived session
CLAUDE.md                    how an agent works inside the control plane
```

**Clone it — do not use "Use this template", and do not fork.** A control
plane is private *and* has to be updatable, and only a clone gives both:
a generated-from-template repo shares no history with its source, so there
is nothing to merge, and GitHub refuses to make a public fork private.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Thurbeen/fleet.git my-control-plane
cd my-control-plane
git remote rename origin template   # the template you later update FROM
gh repo create my-control-plane --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

Then open the clone in your agent CLI and run its `/fleet-onboarding`
skill, which does the setup rather than instructing you through it. By
hand it is the two scripts that skill calls:

```sh
cp registry/owners.example.txt registry/owners.txt   # then edit: you + your orgs
./scripts/sync-registry.sh
./scripts/install-extension.sh
```

It needs `gh` (authenticated), `jq`, and **talos 2.19.0 or newer** —
`extension.toml.in` records why the floor sits exactly there.

That leaves you with a working control-plane session, and a manifest
that registers exactly two things: a `fleet` agent in `agents.toml`, and
one long-lived `fleet` session opened on the checkout.

It is a template, not a talos feature: nothing in talos knows it
exists, and your clone is yours to diverge from immediately. The part
worth copying is the arrangement, not the files. Two of its choices are
that arrangement rather than its own taste.

**The lead's job description is a payload file, not a prompt.** The
manifest's `[[files]]` lays down `FLEET.md` in the extension home and
three `[[symlinks]]` surface it as `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and
`GEMINI.md`, so the lead reads what it is *for* whichever CLI is behind
it. That text is deliberately not the repo's own `AGENTS.md`: one says
what the session is for — hold the plan and the log, never the branches
— and the other says how to work inside the checkout. A lead whose
invariant lives only in the conversation that stated it keeps that
invariant exactly as long as the conversation.

**The manifest ships as `extension.toml.in` because no token spells "my
clone".** `[[sessions]] repo_path` has to name the checkout — that is
where `registry/` and `orchestration/` are — and `{home}` is
substituted, but it resolves to the extension home
(`<config>/extensions/<name>/`). A template cannot hardcode a path that
exists on one machine, so it ships a `__REPO_PATH__` placeholder that
`install-extension.sh` renders from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
before calling `extension install`. A leading `~` *is* expanded there
(`resolved_for_home`) since 0.174.2, and the manifest's floor is well past
that — but expansion would not help anyway: `~` names a home directory, not
a clone, so the placeholder is the permanent answer rather than a
workaround for an old binary.
