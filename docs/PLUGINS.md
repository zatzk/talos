A plugin is one `.lua` file. Drop it in your plugin directory and it loads on the
next save; there is no build step and no restart.

## Start here

Four commands, and you have a pane on screen. None of them need the interface to
be running.

```bash
talos-cli plugin dir          # where plugins live, and which rule chose it
talos-cli plugin new notes    # a starter that already loads
talos-cli plugin check        # does it load? exits non-zero if not
talos-cli plugin list         # every file, where it came from, is it drawn
```

`plugin new` writes [`examples/lua/plugin.lua`](../examples/lua/plugin.lua) under your
chosen name — a pane that renders, declares a key and a setting, and comments the
one rule that catches everybody (see **Traps**). Edit it, run `check`, and it is
live on the next save: the interface watches the directory.

**Which directory?** Two rules — `TALOS_UI_DIR` if it is set, otherwise your own
copy at `~/.config/talos/ui`. `plugin dir` reports the one in force *and why*,
because "my edit did nothing" is almost always the other one.

That third path follows the same rule every other config path does: a **dev
build** (version `0.0.0-dev`) reads `~/.config/talos-dev/ui` instead, beside its
own `settings.toml` and `agents.toml`, so hacking on the interface from a checkout
cannot touch the copy your installed talos uses. Two things make this easy to
misread, and both are worth knowing before you conclude a path is wrong:

- **`TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` wins over both**, and talos *injects it into every
  session it spawns*. So a `talos-cli` run from inside a talos session
  resolves against **that session's** config dir, not the dev default — a dev
  binary invoked there will correctly report the release `ui` directory.
- **Standing in a checkout changes nothing.** A `./ui` beside the working directory
  used to win automatically, which is what made the interface the one config that
  ignored the dev/release split. To work on a checkout's interface, ask for it:
  `TALOS_UI_DIR=ui`, or `just tui-ui` in the repository.

`talos-cli config show` prints the resolved `ui_dir` and `ui_json` alongside
every other config path, which is the quickest way to see which set is in play.

Plugins may declare `ui_state = function() return { open = state.open == true,
selection = state.cursor or 1 } end`. The local `talos-cli ui state` snapshot
calls it on the TUI loop and includes at most 16 scalar fields per plugin, with
short string keys and values. It is a public projection: return only state a
local controller needs, never terminal text, credentials, or the whole `store`.

**Editing the interface from some other session.** The interface directory is a
config path of yours, so a coding agent working in an unrelated repository has no
reason to know it exists. talos handles that for you: the built-in **ui-skill**
extension is on by default and drops one `SKILL.md` (`talos-ui`) into each
coding CLI's personal skill directory, so the agent loads the short form of this
page *when* a request is about changing the TUI, in any session. No extra repo
attached to every session, where it would sit in front of the agent whether or
not the work is about the TUI.

```bash
talos-cli extension deactivate ui-skill   # not wanted; takes every copy back
talos-cli extension activate ui-skill     # and back on
```

```text
<the directory plugin dir reports>/
  layout.lua                   how the screen is arranged
  lib/                         shared modules, via require("lib.theme")
  plugins/*.lua                one file per pane
```

Inside a running interface, the **settings modal's Interface tab** shows the same
inventory `plugin list` does, and restores a file you broke. Open settings with
`Ctrl+,` or `F6`, then `[` / `]` to move between its tabs — or click a heading.

## Traps

Ten mistakes that are invisible until runtime. Each cost real time in the
changes that built the bundled panes.

**Declaring `pure` when your render is not.** A pane may declare that its render
is a function of `talos.*` and `ctx` and nothing else:

```lua
return {
  name = "notes",
  slot = "left",
  pure = true,   -- the kernel may reuse the tree I last returned
  render = function(ctx) ... end,
}
```

In exchange the kernel stops calling it on frames where nothing it can read has
changed — which is most of them, and is the single largest saving available in a
frame. But nothing checks the claim, and getting it wrong gives you a pane
painted from a stale tree, with no error anywhere. Two things disqualify a pane:

- **It writes `store` or `state` from inside `render`.** Those writes stop
  happening on the frames the render is skipped. This is why the bundled search
  strip is deliberately *not* pure — it leaves its content request in `store`
  while rendering.
- **It animates from `ctx.frame`, or from `ctx.elapsed` faster than the shared
  widgets do.** Animating at the shared rate is fine — the working spinner does,
  and the session list is pure — because the kernel keys a cached tree on that
  same tick. Anything finer freezes.

**Reading `ctx.elapsed` is what buys you the animation tick, and only that.**
The clock advances eight times a second for as long as any session is working,
so it is the most frequent thing a cached tree can be keyed on. The kernel keys
your tree on it *if the render that built the tree read `ctx.elapsed`*, and
otherwise serves that tree across the tick — so a pane that draws no spinner
pays nothing for one, and a pane that draws a spinner keeps it moving. There is
nothing to declare and nothing to get wrong in either direction: read the clock
and you are animated, do not and you are still. Read it under a condition (only
for a `working` row, say) and the render that first reads it is the one that
re-keys the entry, so there is no frame on which a stale tree is served.

The mechanism is a metatable on the render context, which has two visible
consequences: `elapsed` is not a *key* of `ctx`, so it does not appear in
`pairs(ctx)`; and that metatable is sealed — `getmetatable(ctx)` is `false` and
`setmetatable(ctx, …)` raises, because one table is shared by every render and a
plugin replacing it would stop every other pane's clock. Every other field is an
ordinary one. Ask `ctx` for facts by name.

Reading `store`/`state` is fine, and so is `command(...)` from a handler. If you
are unsure, leave it undeclared: a pane that says nothing behaves exactly as it
always has, and the only cost is that it is no faster.

**Reading `state` or `store` hands back a copy.** Mutating it changes nothing —
the value is simply the old one on the next frame. Write the whole thing back:

```lua
local flow = state.flow      -- a fresh table, every read
flow.step = "name"
state.flow = flow            -- without this line, nothing happened
```

**Anything a render computes is gone by the time a key arrives.** A value derived
while drawing lives in a local, and a local is invisible to `on_key` — so share a
*function*, not a field, and what a key acts on is by construction what was on
screen.

`state` is the exception, and deliberately so: writes to it land whenever they
happen, render included. Most panes should not need that — deriving twice is simpler
than remembering — but a decision only a render can make (a click deferred until an
incremental parse reaches the row it named) has nowhere else to go. Prefer the shared
function; reach for `state` when the render is the only place that knows.

**A local used above its definition is `nil`, not an error you can read.** Lua
resolves a `local function` from where it appears. `selene ui` catches it as an
undefined variable; the runtime message will not help you.

**`and`/`or` cannot carry a miss.** `matched = searching and fuzzy(q, row) or {}`
turns a *failed* match (`nil`) into an empty table, which then reads as a match —
so a filter silently keeps everything. Spell it as an `if`.

**A Lua character class is a set of *bytes*.** `value:match("[▸▾]")` does not mean
"either of those arrows" — it means any byte occurring in their encodings, which
matches no arrow and plenty of unrelated things. `#` counts bytes for the same reason,
so a column computed from it comes out short on any row with `é` or `╭` in it. This
interface is full of multi-byte glyphs, so both apply constantly: measure with
`text.width`, and compare whole strings rather than classing them.

**A column is not a character either.** `utf8.len` fixes the byte count and stops
there: a CJK glyph is one codepoint over *two* columns and a combining mark one
over none, so a budget counted in codepoints shears every row a double-width name
appears in. `text.width` / `text.truncate` / `text.pad` measure in columns, with
the same `unicode-width` the painter uses. The one place codepoints are right is
`input.cursor`, which is a character offset — `widgets.chars` is that count.

**`ipairs` stops at the first hole.** It is not "iterate the array"; it is "iterate
until a `nil`". A table built by index where one slot was left empty — a diff row with
no old side, a session with no worktree — ends the loop early and *silently*, and the
symptom is never an error: it is a filter that keeps everything, a count that is short,
or a row reported missing that the screen plainly shows. This has cost real time twice,
once in a bundled pane and once in a plugin written against it. If a table can have a
hole, iterate its indices (`for i = 1, n`) or do not leave one.

**A pane in a `switch` slot needs one key that goes both ways.** `command("focus",
{ text = "<your pane>", toggle = true })` focuses it, and focuses whatever you came
from when it already has focus. Without `toggle` the pane is a one-way door: the key
gets you in and only the focus cycle gets you out — and the cycle never gets you in,
since it passes over a slot's alternates. Do not solve that by focusing a
named sibling — the only name available is whatever shares the slot in the *default*
arrangement, which is the user's to change.

**A floating pane needs a slot the arrangement never places.** Otherwise it also
occupies the centre and competes with the terminal. The bundled floats use
`slot = "float"`, which `layout.lua` does not place.

**`on_action` must return `false` while a text field has focus** — and that check
has to be the **first thing it does, for every action**, not a decision made inside
the handler for a particular one. The order is why: a press is resolved against the
registry *before* `on_key` is offered it, so by the time your pane sees the letter
it is already an action. A pane that gates inside `review.refresh` has still
refreshed by the time it notices the find box had focus — the symptom being that
typing a word containing `r` does something, and only that letter.

Every letter your pane declares is a letter somebody will type into a search box.
The flow's `j` moves the list in one focus and types a `j` in another for exactly
this reason.

**A handler that writes `state` on every event repaints on every event.** Right
when the event matters and waste when it does not: check the payload first and
write only what changed. A write that stores the value already there costs
nothing, but a counter that always moves invalidates every pure pane.

**`session.status` fires for the kernel's own derivations too.** A `working`
session that goes quiet for ten seconds reads `idle` (the stuck-working
fallback) and `working` again when it prints; a handler reacting to
`to == "working"` sees both edges.

## Making a pane fast

The trap above says when `pure` is wrong; this is the positive half — the
levers, in the order they pay:

1. **`pure = true`** wherever the render only reads. The kernel reuses the last
   tree until something it read changes and skips your Lua entirely — the
   single largest saving available, and doubly so for floats, which render
   every frame even while closed.
2. **Memoize derived models on published-table identity.** Every gated group
   (`talos.sessions`, `talos.theme`, `talos.registry`, `talos.diffs`,
   `talos.bookmarks`, …) keeps the *same table object* until its data moves,
   so `rawequal(published, cache.src)` is a sound one-comparison staleness
   test. Build once into an upvalue, rebuild on identity change. Never key a
   cache on anything time-based.
3. **Window before you build.** `ui.list` does this for you — it calls `row`
   only for the rows it draws — and under it are `widgets.window` and
   `lib/scroll` for variable-height rows. Either way a thousand-row list costs
   its ten visible rows.
4. **Hoist per-row work.** A `store` read crosses the VM boundary; a
   `theme.role` lookup walks tables; `fuzzy.compile(query)` splits the query
   once so per-row matching does not. Read once per render, pass down.
5. **Concatenate through a table.** `s = s .. piece` across a wide row is
   O(width²); accumulate and `table.concat`, or emit `string.rep` runs.
6. **Animate off the shared clock only** — `theme.spinner_frame(ctx.elapsed)`
   follows the kernel's animation tick, which advances only while something is
   animating. A hand-rolled timer re-renders forever and defeats `pure`. And
   read `ctx.elapsed` only where you actually animate: reading it is what
   subscribes your tree to the tick, so hoisting it to the top of a render that
   usually draws nothing moving costs you the cache eight times a second.

`F12` (the perf HUD) is the check: `renders` climbing on an untouched screen
means a pane is not settling. To find **which** pane, read the `panes` table
under the counters — one row per plugin, most expensive first, the worst in red
and a `!` on any pane with a hint — then run `talos-cli perf --plugins` for
render p50/p95/max, handler time, reuse, `run` durations, `store` writes per
render and tree size, with each hint spelled out (`--json` to script it). The
hints name the traps above: not `pure` yet rendering every frame, a float
rendering while closed, a fresh table written to `store` from a render, a pure
pane that keeps re-rendering while idle. The bundled panes are worked examples — the
session list's memoized model (`lib/session_model.lua`), the flow's row cache,
and the search strip's per-session content memo.

## The directory tells you this too

`AGENTS.md` and `README.md` are delivered into the interface directory itself, so a
session pointed at it has the rules to hand without finding this file. `AGENTS.md`
is the one a coding CLI loads on its own; it is deliberately short and covers what
is easy to get wrong — that "install a plugin" is `talos-cli plugin install` and
not a package manager, that `plugin check` gates every edit, and that adding a pane
is two edits. `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` beside them point at it rather than
repeating it.

## Your copy of the interface

The bundled panes are not special files. They are written into your directory on
first run and read back from it, so the interface you were shipped is the
interface you edit — there is no second, privileged copy running underneath.

| You want to | Do this |
|---|---|
| change a bundled pane | edit the file; it reloads on save and is never overwritten again |
| add one | drop a `.lua` file in `plugins/` |
| replace one | write your own and **delete** the bundled file |
| remove one | delete the file |
| undo either | settings → Interface, select it, `r` |
| turn one off | settings → Interface, select it, `space` |
| get back a working interface after a bad edit | [When something goes wrong](#when-something-goes-wrong) |

**Deleting is how you remove.** A file talos wrote and can no longer find is
recorded as removed and is not written again — not on the next start, and not by
an upgrade that changes it. Nothing is lost by it: the shipped copy is in the
binary, so `r` in the Interface tab puts it back, and the same key discards your edits
to a file you would rather have back as it shipped — after asking, since nothing
keeps the edit.

What an upgrade does to each file follows from the same record:

- **untouched** → updated, so fixes reach you;
- **edited** → left alone, and reported;
- **removed** → left removed;
- **yours** → not touched, ever. Delivery writes only files it ships;
- **no longer shipped** → taken back if you never changed it, kept if you did.
  The one exception is `plugins/25_shell.lua`, from v2.32.0's rolled-back layout
  presets: an edited copy is moved to `plugins/25_shell.lua.bak`, because loaded
  it fills a slot the classic layout never places.

Removing every pane is allowed and does what it says: nothing draws, the chrome
still works, and the Interface tab still lists what you removed. It is not treated as a broken
directory.

## The smallest plugin

```lua
return {
  name = "hello",
  slot = "center",
  focusable = true,

  render = function(ctx)
    return { type = "text", text = "hello from " .. ctx.width .. " columns" }
  end,
}
```

`render` returns a plain table describing what to draw. **Lua never holds a
ratatui object** — that indirection is why reloading is safe, and why a plugin
that throws costs its own pane and nothing else.

## What you get

| Global | What it is |
|---|---|
| `talos` | Everything readable: sessions, tasks, automations, repos, agents, hosts, theme, registry, diffs, links |
| `command(kind, opts)` | The only way to change anything. Enqueues and returns |
| `state` | Private to your plugin. Survives a reload; **not** a restart |
| `store` | Shared by every plugin — the bus between them. Same lifetime as `state` |
| `files.list/read` | Directory entries and file text, rooted at a session's directory |
| `text.width/truncate/pad` | Display width in terminal COLUMNS, and the two cuts that spend a budget in it |
| `talos.settings` | The settings in force: every `[features]` switch, plus the panel breakpoints and scrollback. Read your own switch and decline to draw when it is off — the kernel gates only what it owns |
| `talos.search` | The content search's answer: lines found in every session's terminals, scrollback included, ranked, each with how far back it is (`back`) and the scroll offset that shows it (`scroll`). Served only while `store.want_content` holds a query (optionally narrowed by `store["want_content.sessions"]`), off the render thread; an empty query reads every history into the cache and matches nothing, so an open search strip is ready before the first keystroke; nil until the first answer lands |
| `talos.bookmarks/browse/branches/worktrees` | The creation flow's reads: remembered repositories, a directory listing, a base-branch list, the worktrees a repo already has — each served only while `store.want_bookmarks`/`want_browse`/`want_branches`/`want_worktrees` asks for it |
| `require` | Loads **any** `.lua` under the interface directory, and nothing outside it |

That is worth stating on its own, because it is easy to read `require` as "the
`lib/` the interface shipped": **a pure-Lua library can be vendored into a plugin's
own repository and required from there**, with no kernel change and no capability.
`require("your-pane.vendor.thing")` resolves like any other path, and `plugin
install git+…` is already the delivery mechanism for a repository that carries more
than one file. A Lua tokenizer, a date library, a pretty-printer — none of those
need anything added to the sandbox.

What that does *not* reach is native code. `package` is absent, so there is no
`loadlib` and no C module: anything with a compiled component (tree-sitter, PCRE2)
is out, and would be out even with a grant, because Lua runs on the loop thread and
a blocking call there freezes the frame. `run` and a program pane exist precisely
because they are off the render path by construction.

**There is no filesystem, no process spawning and no network.** Not because they
are blocked — because they are not there. A capability you were not granted is
absent from the environment, so there is nothing to call. `io`, `os`, `debug`,
`dofile`, `loadfile`, `print` and `warn` are all withheld.

You will hear about it before you run it. `selene ui` checks `ui/` against
`talos.yml`, and `lua-language-server --check ui` against `.luarc.json` — between
them every withheld capability is declared absent, so reaching for one is a lint
error rather than a nil-index at the moment someone opens your pane. `stylua ui`
formats. All three run in CI; selene and stylua also run on commit.

## Names, checked before you run

Absence is the loud half. The quiet half is everything that *is* there and is
simply misspelt: `convert.rs` drops a node key it does not know (deliberately —
that is how you carry your own bookkeeping on the node table), `command` reads a
fixed list of option names and collects the rest into an event payload, and a
theme role no palette defines is nil. All three render something plausible and
report nothing.

`ui/lib/talos.d.lua` is those names written down as lua-language-server types:
every node prop and the values it accepts, `ctx`, the `hit`/`key`/`wheel`
payloads, the declaration table, every published `talos.*` row, every command
verb's options, and the theme roles. `.luarc.json` loads it, so an editor opened
on the repository — or on your own interface directory — has it already.

lua-language-server will not flag an **extra** key in a table constructor, so the
file is written to catch a typo the other way round:

```lua
---@type talos.TextNode
local row = { type = "text", txet = "hello" }
-- Missing required fields in type `talos.TextNode`: `text`

command("open", { url = "https://example.com" })
-- Missing required fields in type `talos.cmd.Open`: `text`

local colour = theme.warning
-- Undefined field `warning`.
```

The first needs the `---@type` line: without an annotation there is no type to
check the table against. The second and third need nothing — `command` and
`lib/theme.lua` are typed already.

Those three examples are literally `tests/fixtures/lua_types/`, and
`scripts/ci/check-lua-types.sh` fails if any of them stops being reported.

`selene` checks the same names from the other side, against `talos.yml`. That
file declares **fields**, not only tables, so `talos.platform.os`,
`talos.granted.program`, `talos.metrics.system.cpu_percent` and
`talos.hover.role` are all checked reads and a misspelt one is an error. A path
stops being checked at the first `[…]` — `talos.sessions[i].name` is yours to
get wrong — which is why a list is declared only as far as the list itself.
`tests/fixtures/lua_std/` and `scripts/ci/check-lua-std.sh` are that half's
probes: `reads.lua` reads every field on `granted`, `platform`, `metrics`,
`hover`, `preflight.mux`, `settings`, `theme.roles`, the four creation-flow reads
and `runs` — the tables no bundled pane reads in a form selene can see — and must
lint clean, while `typos/` holds one pane per table misspelling one field, each of
which must not.

## The four node kinds

`text`, `box`, `input`, `surface`. That is the whole vocabulary, and it is meant
to stay that way.

Lists, gauges, panels, dividers and tables are **not** node kinds — they are
Lua, composed from the four. When you need a new appearance, add it there. A
prior version of this design froze its catalog at six kinds and watched it reach
sixteen, because every new appearance had nowhere else to go and each one cost a
release. A widget in Lua costs a file save.

The Lua side is two layers. `lib/ui.lua` is the **component layer** — the shapes
a pane turns out to be, and the conventions that make several panes look like one
program — and it is what a new pane should reach for first:

```lua
local ui = require("lib.ui")

ui.panel({ title = "Notes", focused = ctx.focused, body = ui.list({ … }) })
ui.list({ items = rows, cursor = ui.cursor("notes", rows), row = spans_of, … })
ui.row({ width = w }):add(name, { fg = theme.text }):trailing(age):spans_list()
ui.modal({ title = "Pick one", cols = 60, children = { body, ui.footer({ … }) } })
```

| | what it is |
|---|---|
| `ui.panel{title, focused, body, overlay_left, overlay_right, right_column, border, title_align}` | a framed pane in the one focus convention — with focus a thick border and a ` ▸ ` title badge, without it a thin border in `border_unfocused` (`ui/README.md` → Focus) |
| `ui.list{items, cursor, width, height, row, header, empty, on_overflow, pad, len, fill}` | a scrolling list: variable row heights, the sticky window, the selection bar, hover, and overflow either as marker rows or as `▲ N`/`▼ N` on the frame |
| `ui.cursor(key, items, opts)` | the selection over a list, with `move`/`select`/`select_by_id`/`follow`. What it remembers is the selected **item**, and the row is re-derived from it on every build, so a list reordered underneath keeps the cursor on the same thing; the remembered row number answers only once that item has gone, and then it names whatever took its place. `opts.steer` names the `store` key another pane moves this list with — and the protocol that tells a foreign write from this list's own echo |
| `ui.row{width, tone}` | a span builder that knows the row's columns: `:add`, `:gap`, `:button`, `:match`, `:trailing`, `:spans_list` |
| `ui.empty{title, width, hint, hint_action}` | the one empty state, its chord shown only while something is bound to it |
| `ui.modal{title, cols, children}` / `ui.footer{actions, primary, cancel}` | a float sized from its children, and hints resolved from the key registry |
| `ui.status` / `ui.dots` / `ui.rule` / `ui.chord` / `ui.describe` / `ui.follow` / `ui.reset` | a status glyph with its spinner, the border strip of them, a group heading, and the registry lookups |

`lib/widgets.lua` is the **primitive kit** underneath it — measurement,
windowing, `widgets.list`, `widgets.panel`, `widgets.gauge`. Reach past `ui` for
what it does not cover:

```lua
local widgets = require("lib.widgets")

widgets.list({ rows = rows, selected = 3, height = ctx.height - 2 })
widgets.panel("title", ctx.focused)
widgets.gauge(0.7, { width = 20 })
```

`widgets.list` sizes itself — pass `len` or `fill` alongside the rows rather
than patching the returned table — and windows itself: when the rows outrun
`height` it spends a line of its own on an `↑ N more` / `↓ N more` marker, so
the count is exactly what you cannot see and no row is drawn over. Give it
`selected_style` and `hover_style` and it puts them on the row itself, which is
the `text` style below. `lib/hover.lua` holds the styles every bundled pane
lights a row, a pill and a field border with (`hover.row_style`,
`hover.button_style`, `hover.border`) — `ui/README.md` → Hover.

A `text` node takes a **`style` of its own**, painted across its whole rect
before the spans go on top:

```lua
{ type = "text", style = { bg = theme.role("selection_bg"), bold = true },
  text = { spans } }
```

That is what a selection bar or a hover band is. The style reaches the right
edge of the rect whatever the spans say, so nothing has to append a spacer span
sized by hand — and a span that names a colour keeps it, because the node style
only supplies what a span left unsaid. A search highlight therefore stays
visible on the selected row with the bar painting through it.

`input` carries one thing the other three do not: a claim on the **caret**. A
screen can hold several fields and the terminal has one cursor, so the field
being typed into says so with `focused = true` and the others say nothing — and
a field that claims it keeps the caret whether or not it holds text, because a
field showing its placeholder is still the field you are typing into.
`lib/textinput.lua` passes its own `focused` option through, so a pane built on
it already does the right thing; a raw `input` node that never sets the flag
draws no caret at all, which is visible at once. A caret guessed from the value
being non-empty is not: it wanders to whichever field happens to hold text.

Every kind takes a **`frame`**, and a frame is the whole border vocabulary:

```lua
frame = {
  title = { { text = " Sessions ", style = badge } },  -- styled runs, not a string
  title_align = "right",                               -- left | center | right
  border_type = "square",                              -- rounded (default) | square
  border_style = { fg = theme.accent },
  padding = 1,
  overlay = {
    top_right = dots,        -- painted leftward from before the top-right corner
    right_column = bar,      -- one run per inner row, down the right border
  },
}
```

`overlay` paints runs onto the frame's *own* border cells, after the block draws
them — `top_left` and `top_right` along the top border, `bottom_left` and
`bottom_right` along the bottom, `right_column` down the right one. A status
strip, a `▲ N` scroll count or a scrollbar there costs no content cell, which is
the reason it exists: the session list's dot strip and the terminal pane's
scrollbar are both border cells, and every row of the pane stays a row. Each slot
clips between the corners, which are never painted over.

`surface` is the exception that proves the rule: it carries **cells**, for
content positioned by character measurement rather than by structure — a live
terminal, or a diff body. You place and frame it; the kernel fills it. `scroll`
sets how far back a terminal is scrolled, and `mark` names one row (from the top of
the surface) the kernel draws reversed over whatever the cells are — how the
terminal pane points at the line a search landed it on.

The cost of that split, which is easy to meet as a mystery rather than as a fact:
**cells never become nodes, so a surface is invisible to anything that walks the node
tree** — including your own tests. An assertion that looks for text in the tree finds
none of a diff body's content and *matches nothing rather than failing*, which reads
as the feature being broken. Anything asserting on what a surface shows has to go
through the cells you handed it.

## Sizing, and why your rect is known

Every child of a `box` says how much of the axis it wants:

```lua
{ len = 3 }      -- exactly three
{ pct = 50 }     -- half
{ fill = 2 }     -- twice the share of a fill = 1 sibling
{ min = 5, max = 20 }
```

`ctx.width` and `ctx.height` are **your pane's**, not the screen's. The kernel
resolves every rect before calling you, which is what makes wrapping,
truncation and scroll windows possible at all.

## Slots: where your pane lands

`slot` names the region of `layout.lua` your plugin draws into. The stock
arrangement is two columns:

| Slot | Where | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `sessions` | far left | width ≥ 80 **and** toggled open (F9) |
| `center` | the remainder | always |

A pane that only ever floats — the new-session flow is the bundled example —
names a slot nothing places, so it never competes for the centre.

A slot exists because a plugin fills it, not the other way round: v1's `info`,
`tasks` and `files` columns and its header/footer bands were removed with their
plugins, and their slots went too — a slot nothing can fill would reserve a rect
for nothing. **Adding a pane means adding its slot to `layout.lua`**, which is a
file you edit rather than a layout compiled into the binary.

Several plugins may name the same slot. `center` is a **switch** slot — one
occupant is visible at a time and focusing one brings it forward. The `ctrl+h` /
`ctrl+l` cycle walks columns, not panes: it stops **once** per switch slot, on its
default occupant (the first focusable one — the agent pane in `center`), and from an
alternate it steps off the slot rather than back to its sibling. An alternate is
reached only by asking for it — its own key, a pill, or a `focus:<plugin>` click
role — so a pane that replaces the centre needs one of those or nothing reaches it
(`plugin check` warns about a pill-less one). A slot the arrangement
did not place this frame simply does not draw, and focus skips its plugins, so a
closed column can never hold focus.

The distinction between "not drawn" and "cannot hold focus" is load-bearing:
focusing a switch alternate is *what makes it drawn*, so the two questions have
separate answers in `kernel::focus`. Conflating them cost the old plugins pane every
way in it had — the ring skipped it, and its own opening chord was undone a frame
later by the guard that keeps focus off closed columns.

A pane may open **its own** column and ask for focus in the same action — show the
panel, then `command("focus", { text = name })`, the way `65_search.lua` does. The
slot does not exist until the arrangement runs again, so the kernel holds that
request for one layout and takes it there; you do not have to wait a frame or press
the chord twice.

Because layout resolves *before* render, anything the arrangement needs to know
cannot live inside a render function. Panel visibility therefore lives in
`lib/panels.lua`, which keeps it in `store` so it survives a reload:

```lua
local panels = require("lib.panels")

panels.shown("sessions")   -- is the column open?
panels.toggle("sessions")  -- flip it, returns the new state
```

## Colour: name roles, never values

```lua
local theme = require("lib.theme")
{ text = "hi", style = { fg = theme.accent } }     -- yes
{ text = "hi", style = { fg = "#5fafff" } }        -- no
```

The active theme resolves roles to colours. Naming a role means your pane
follows every one of the 36 built-in themes and any the user wrote, without you
knowing they exist. Hardcoding a colour opts out of that for everyone
downstream — and there is a test that greps the bundled plugins for literals.

## Keys: declare them, don't just handle them

```lua
keys = {
  { key = "j", action = "mine.next", desc = "next item" },
  { key = "ctrl+n", action = "mine.new", desc = "new", scope = "global" },
},

on_action = function(action)
  if action == "mine.next" then ... return true end
  return false
end,
```

Declaring keys as data is what lets the kernel list them in help, detect a clash
with another plugin, and let the user rebind them — none of which it could do if
they only existed inside `on_key`. Help is a kernel modal rather than a plugin,
and it renders the registry, so your key appears in it (and becomes rebindable)
by being declared and nothing else. The same is true of `settings`: declare
`{ id, desc, default }` and the settings modal grows a row for it.

A plugin can also **write** its own settings — `command("set", { text =
"yourpane.wrap", flag = true })` for a boolean, `number = 2` for a number, or
`value = "compact"` for text. A `state` value may hold the requested value until
the queued command lands; after that, read the registry's value so a change in
the settings modal is respected. One durable home per setting.
Plugin-scoped keys fire only while you have focus, so several panes can all
declare `j`.

Chords are canonicalised, which matters more than it sounds: `shift+j` reaches
you the same way whether the terminal reports a bare `J` or `j` plus SHIFT, and
`ctrl+/` works across all three encodings terminals use for it. `cmd+…` is the
macOS Command key (`super`, `command` and `win` parse as aliases; `cmd` is
canonical), which arrives only from a terminal speaking the kitty keyboard
protocol — `on_key` sees it as `key.cmd` beside `key.ctrl`/`key.alt`/`key.shift`.

A global `ctrl+<letter>` is also a chord the agent's own line editing wants
(`ctrl+r` is reverse-search, `ctrl+d` is EOF). Add `passthrough = true` and a
focused terminal keeps the keystroke while your action stays reachable from
every other pane — which is why the panes that do this also declare an F-key
alternate. It applies only while the bound chord is a bare `ctrl+<letter>`, so a
user who rebinds you onto `f7` gets the action back in the terminal.

`on_key(key)` still exists for panes that need every keystroke — the terminal
uses it, alongside `input = "session"` to forward what it does not handle.

## Events: be told, rather than look

```lua
events = { "session.status", "focus.session" },

on_event = function(name, payload)
  if name == "session.status" and payload.to == "blocked" then
    store.focus_session = payload.session
  end
end,
```

A pane used to learn that the world changed only by being rendered and diffing
the snapshot itself. Declare what you listen for and the kernel calls you **once
per change**, off the render path, with the tables current: a session appeared,
disappeared, changed status, name or branch; the selection or the focused pane
moved; a command a plugin issued finished or failed; a program you started
ended; the interface reloaded. The
whole list, with each payload, is `talos-cli plugin events` and the last
section of `F1`.

The kernel **derives** these by diffing the snapshot, so a session made by
`talos-cli`, a cron tick or a second talos fires the same `session.created`
as one the creation flow made. The four `session.post_*` names are the exception
and the reason there are two spellings: they fire only for an operation *this*
interface performed, with that operation's facts, and share their names with
`hooks.toml` so shell and Lua learn one vocabulary. Subscribe to
`session.created` to hear about every session; to `session.post_create` to hear
about the one you asked for.

A handler gets exactly what a render gets — the published tables, `state`,
`store`, `command` — and its return value is ignored: it cannot answer, block or
veto, only write state and enqueue. It runs under the render's instruction
budget, and one that throws costs its own subscription for that event: the other
subscribers still run, your pane still draws, and the failure is reported once
per event in the message band rather than painted into your rect every frame.

**One event is addressed rather than broadcast.** `program.exited` goes only to
the plugin whose pane it was. A program pane belongs to the plugin that started
it and no other plugin can even name it, so the news that it ended has the same
owner — and two plugins may both call their pane `editor`, which a broadcast
would have each of them acting on. Every other event is about something every
pane can already see in the snapshot, and is delivered to every subscriber.

`program.exited` fires for every program **this run of the interface started**,
however it ended — including one that died before the loop looked at it again,
and including twice in a row when a program was restarted and its replacement
also ended before the next look (two programs really did end). One death,
though, is one event: a program restarted on a *later* frame does not re-announce
the ending that was already reported, so a handler that restarts on the event
restarts once. What it does not announce is a corpse adopted from a *previous*
run: that program stopped while nothing was watching, and reporting it at boot
would tell a pane its editor had just closed.

**A subscription to a name nothing emits refuses to load** (`plugin check` says
which), because a handler that never fires is the one failure with no symptom.

**Plugins can talk to each other.** `command("emit", { text = "refresh", scope =
"x" })` reaches every plugin subscribed to `user.refresh` on the next iteration,
with the other fields as the payload and `payload.source` set to your name — by
the kernel, so nobody can forge it. A kernel name cannot be emitted. Emits may
cascade (a handler emitting to a handler) four generations deep per dispatch;
the fifth is dropped and reported, so two plugins cannot pin the loop between
them.

`examples/lua/events.lua` is the worked example: it selects the session that
just went `blocked`, unless you moved the selection yourself in the last few
seconds.

## The palette: an action without a chord

```lua
commands = {
  { action = "mine.export", desc = "export the list" },
},
```

`Ctrl+P` opens the command palette — every plugin's declared keys, every
`commands` entry, and the kernel's own modals, reload and quit — filtered as you
type, with the chord beside each row that has one. `Enter` runs the chosen row
through the same `on_action` a key press takes, **whether or not your pane is
focused**, so an action must not assume it is (the bundled panes key off `state`
and `store.selected`, never on focus). A command and a key for one action are
one row; a user may later bind a chord to a command from `F1`, at which point it
is a key like any other.

The running interface publishes these declarations through `talos-cli ui
actions` and `talos-cli schema`. A plugin action keeps its existing
`on_action(action)` callback; a typed invocation may pass a read-only second
argument table. Declare argument and effect metadata alongside keys when an
action takes input:

```lua
actions = { { name = "mine.search", effect = "ui-write", args = {
  { name = "query", kind = "string" },
} } },
```

Supported argument kinds are `string` and `uuid`; `required = true` refuses
an omitted argument. Action IDs reserved by the kernel cannot be claimed by a
plugin. `talos-cli plugin check` warns about raw `on_click` handlers and
menu or click action names missing from the catalog. Key and scroll handlers
remain available through addressed `ui input` for the active pane; give
repeatable controls a declared semantic action.

## Clicks: give the node an identity

The kernel hit-tests the tree it just painted, so a node becomes a click target
by carrying identity — the same `id` / `class` / `role` a decorator matches on.
Nothing else is declared, and there is no new node kind.

For the cases where a click should do exactly what a key does, `role` names the
verb and the kernel answers it without calling you at all:

```lua
{ type = "text", len = 8, role = "action:themes.open", text = " Theme " }
{ type = "text", len = 5, role = "key:ctrl+q",         text = " Quit " }
{ type = "text", len = 7, role = "focus:notes",        text = " Notes " }
{ type = "text", len = 1, role = "url:" .. mr.url,     text = { … } }
```

- `action:<id>` runs a declared action, on whichever plugin declared it — so one
  pane's button can name an action belonging to a pane it has never heard of.
- `key:<chord>` replays the keystroke through the handler the keyboard uses, so
  a button and its letter cannot come to mean different things.
- `focus:<plugin>` focuses that plugin, which in a `switch` slot is also how its
  view is brought forward.
- `url:<link>` opens the link, and is the one verb that also changes how the
  node is *painted* — see below.

A **run inside a line** carries `id`/`role` of its own, and becomes a target over
the columns it is laid out at:

```lua
{ type = "text", text = { {
  { text = " ◀ ", style = accent, role = "action:sessions.toggle_panel" },
  { text = "F9 ", style = muted,  role = "action:sessions.toggle_panel" },
} } }
```

so a chip inside a row needs no node of its own with a hand-counted `len`.
Adjacent runs carrying the **same** identity coalesce into one hitbox — which is
what makes that two-colour button one button rather than two halves the pointer
has to find. It applies to a frame's overlay runs too: the terminal pane's
scrollbar is one target the length of its column because every row of it names
the same role.

### `url:` is a link, not just a click

The value is the whole rest of the role, so a url keeps its own `:` and `//`
(`url:https://example.test/a`, `url:mailto:me@example.test`). A plain click hands
it to the same opener a `Ctrl+Click` on a link in an agent's transcript rides —
including the copy-to-clipboard fallback that carries the url back over ssh — so
a pane's link and a transcript's link cannot open in two different places.

What the other verbs do not do: the node's **drawn cells are re-printed wrapped
in OSC 8**, so `Ctrl+Click` over them is answered by the terminal talos itself
runs in. That matters because a pane hands the kernel cells and can emit no
escape of its own, and because on a remote host the outer terminal is the only
leg with a browser to reach. The chord is resolved against `url:` nodes directly
as well, so it still works in an emulator with no OSC 8 support, or on a bare
tty.

Four consequences worth knowing:

- The cells are read back out of the **frame just drawn**, not out of your tree,
  so a node clipped by its pane, covered by a modal or under a float contributes
  no link — the same rule an agent's own runs follow.
- Blank cells are trimmed from either end, because the rect a node was given is
  wider than the glyphs in it and linking the padding would underline the whole
  row. Interior blanks stay, so ` Open MR !123 ` links as `Open MR !123`.
- A node spanning several rows emits one link per row, all naming the same url —
  which is how a wrapped link is spelled in OSC 8 anyway.
- The re-print is written **outside the frame diff**, so it has to spend exactly
  as many columns as the cells it came from. A wide glyph is one cell and two
  columns, and re-printing it moves the cursor over both — so the blank ratatui
  leaves beside it is skipped rather than printed. Getting that wrong is
  permanent, not transient: the next frame repaints only the cells it believes
  moved, so a row shifted by one column stays shifted.

`command("open", { text = url })` is the imperative half, for a link you open
from a keypress rather than a click. The field is `text`, not `url`.

Everything else — a list row, most often — is offered to the plugin that painted
it:

```lua
on_click = function(hit)
  -- hit.id, hit.class, hit.role, plus hit.x / hit.y inside the node's own rect
  -- and hit.w / hit.h, its size; hit.clicks is 2 on a double-click
  if not hit.id then return false end
  state.cursor = index_of(hit.id)
  return true
end,
```

`hit.w` / `hit.h` are there so a coordinate can be resolved against the shape it
landed in without the pane keeping geometry from its last render — which a
`pure` pane cannot do at all, since `render` may not write.

`hit.clicks` is `2` for the second press on the same node within 400 ms of the
first, and `1` for any other press — the kernel counts, because a pane has no
clock outside `render`. A third quick press is `1` again, so a pane that opens
on `2` opens once. The bundled session list is the worked example: a single
click selects the row and leaves the keyboard in the column, a double-click also
hands focus to the agent pane, exactly as Enter does. The node is the same node
by its `id`, so a row that gained a `selected` class between the two presses
still doubles; a node with no `id` never reads `2`, and a press anywhere else in
between — the chrome, a modal, a terminal — makes the next one a first again.

Return `false` and the press falls through, which is what lets the same click
that focused a terminal also start a drag-selection over it. A pane needs no
`on_click` to be clickable: any click focuses the pane it lands in first.

Rows built by `widgets.list` already carry `role = "row"` and whatever `id` you
gave them, so a list is clickable as soon as it has an `on_click`.

**A `surface` can be clicked too, and this is the escape hatch that makes a
geometry-first pane interactive.** A surface carries an `id` like any other node, the
paint walk records the rect of anything carrying identity, and `hit.x` / `hit.y` arrive
*inside* that rect — so a pane resolves a coordinate to whatever it drew there, from the
map it necessarily already has. Cells have no per-line identity and do not need any: the
thing that decided where every row went is the thing that receives the coordinate. That
is what lets a side-by-side diff aim a click at the old or the new column with nothing
added to the node catalog.

### The right button

A RIGHT press has its own hook, `on_context`, with the same `hit` payload:

```lua
on_context = function(hit)
  if not hit.id then return false end
  store.menu = {                       -- the bundled menu float, at the pointer
    at = { x = hit.screen_x, y = hit.screen_y },
    items = {
      { label = "Open", action = "files.open" },
      "sep",
      { label = "Delete", action = "files.delete" },
    },
  }
  return true
end,
```

`hit.screen_x`/`hit.screen_y` are the pressed cell on the screen, where
`hit.x`/`hit.y` are inside the node. The bundled `64_menu` float draws whatever
`store.menu` holds at that point, moves over it with `j`/`k` or the arrows, and on
`enter` or a click closes and runs the entry's action through `command("action")`
— so an entry does exactly what its chord does. `esc`, or a press anywhere else,
closes it. The sessions column opens its own this way.

Give the menu a `target` (the row's id, say) when the entries are about one
thing. The menu passes it as the action's read-only `args.target`; the owner
can refuse when that row has gone before the action lands. The bundled sessions
menu sets `target_argument = "session_id"`, so its contributed actions receive
the session UUID as `args.session_id`. The bundled menu also leaves the older
`store["menu.chosen"]` handoff until edited copies of either bundled pane have
been migrated; new handlers should use the typed argument.

For a soft delete passed through a confirmation pane, `command("delete")` can
take `remember = { key = "sessions.deleted", value = id }` inside its options.
The store write happens when the command is issued, so a preserved older
confirmation pane retains undo without creating an undo target on cancel.

An entry's `action` has to be one some plugin **declares**, in `keys` or in
`commands`: that declaration is how `command("action")` finds the pane whose
`on_action` answers it. An undeclared one falls back to the menu float itself,
which answers nothing, so the entry closes the menu and does nothing — declare
`files.open` and `files.delete` in the example above, or they are dead entries.

#### Adding entries to the sessions menu

The sessions column's row menu is open to other plugins. A plugin that owns a
per-session action offers it by leaving its entries in
`store["sessions.menu_extra"]`, under its own name. Write it at the top level
of your file, which runs on every load and reload, or from a handler — never
from `render`:

```lua
local extra = store["sessions.menu_extra"] or {}
extra["auto-continue"] = {
  { label = "Auto-continue", action = "auto-continue.toggle" },
}
store["sessions.menu_extra"] = extra   -- a read is a copy: write it back
```

Each contributor's list takes the same entries and `"sep"` rules as
`store.menu.items`. The pane appends them after its own entries when a row's
menu opens, contributors in name order and each after a rule. Keying the table
by owner means rewriting your own list never overwrites another plugin's, and
writing the same list again changes nothing. Write `nil` under your name to
withdraw.

An entry is shown only if its action is **declared**, in `keys` or in
`commands`, so a misspelt or removed action is dropped rather than offered as a
dead entry. A rule left with nothing to separate is dropped with it. A `label`
that is not a string is ignored, and the entry shows its action's name. Entries
appear on a row's menu only, never on the menu for empty space. The check reads
`talos.registry.keys` and `talos.registry.commands`, the palette's
chord-less rows.

The pane opens the menu with `target` set to the row that was pressed. Read it
from the action's typed arguments, since the cursor may have moved by the time
the action lands:

```lua
on_action = function(action, args)
  if action ~= "auto-continue.toggle" then return false end
  local session = type(args) == "table" and args.session_id
  session = session or store.selected   -- run from Ctrl+P, not the menu
  -- …act on `session`…
  return true
end,
```

Its own hook rather than a button field on `hit`, because the two presses do not
mean the same thing to anyone. Every `on_click` ever written reads "act on this
row" — open the file, run the action — so a right press arriving there would do
exactly that, in every pane, the moment the kernel began forwarding it. This way
a pane that declares no `on_context` never hears a right press at all.

It is a much shorter road than the left button's: no verb is resolved, no link
is opened, no selection is begun, and **the focus does not move**. What a right
press means is entirely the pane's to decide.

Not every terminal sends one. The emulator may bind the right button to paste or
to a menu of its own and never forward it, and nothing here can tell that apart
from a button nobody pressed — it is the user's setting to make. To check a
terminal, run `printf '\e[?1000h\e[?1006h'; cat -v` in it and right-click: a
line like `^[[<2;12;7M` means the press is being forwarded. (`Ctrl-C`, then
`printf '\e[?1000l\e[?1006l'` to put the terminal back.)

### Dragging

A node whose `role` is exactly `drag` takes **hold of the pointer**: the press
arms no text selection, and every move until the button comes up is delivered to
that node as a further click with `hit.dragging = true`. That is the whole of
what a scrollbar, a slider or a splitter needs from four node kinds — the kernel
only keeps routing the pointer; what the movement *means* stays the pane's.

```lua
-- the bundled terminal pane's scrollbar, in outline
on_click = function(hit)
  if hit.role ~= "drag" then return false end
  if not hit.dragging then state.grabbed_at = hit.y - thumb_start() end
  state.offset = offset_for(hit.y - state.grabbed_at, hit.h)
  return true
end,
```

Two things follow from where the grab is held:

- **A drag that wanders off the node is still that node's**, clamped to the rect
  it was pressed in. Hit-testing every move afresh would hand the gesture to
  whatever it wandered onto, which is not what any scrollbar does.
- **Take the grab offset at the press, not at every move.** Without it the thing
  being dragged jumps so that the point you grabbed becomes its top — very
  visible on a tall scrollbar thumb.

It is deliberately not one of the click *verbs*: those name something the kernel
does on the pane's behalf, and here the kernel does nothing but deliver. The
bare role composes with the `id` a node already carries, so a pane with two
draggables tells them apart the way it tells two rows apart.

### The wheel

A wheel tick over a pane is offered to that pane — the one under the pointer,
not the focused one — before it becomes anything else:

```lua
on_scroll = function(wheel)
  -- wheel.up, plus wheel.x / wheel.y inside the pane's own rect
  state.offset = math.max(0, state.offset + (wheel.up and -1 or 1))
  return true
end,
```

Decline it (`false`, or declare no `on_scroll`) and the kernel synthesizes an
`up`/`down` keystroke for the pane instead, so a pane that already declares
those keys scrolls by the wheel with nothing added — and the wheel cannot come
to mean something its arrow keys do not.

The hook exists for the pane that cannot take that fallback: a pane declaring
`input = "session"` hands every unclaimed key to the agent, so declaring `up`
there would take the arrow keys away from whatever is running in it. Without a
tick of its own the wheel did nothing at all over a live terminal.

Two rules follow from where each half sits:

- **`on_scroll` is one report; the keystroke fallback is one notch.** A detent
  is several reports (three, for ghostty, kitty and xterm) and the fallback
  folds them into one step, because a pane that moves a *selection* must not
  walk three rows per flick. A pane that scrolls by lines wants all three, which
  is also what a tick forwarded to a pty delivers.
- **A live terminal that asked for the mouse is served before either.** The
  kernel forwards the tick to the pty instead, since a program on the alternate
  screen keeps no scrollback for anyone else to scroll.

Everything here is inert when `[features] mouse` is off — the capture escape is
never sent, so the terminal keeps its own selection and scrolling.

## Changing things

```lua
command("delete",  { session = id })
command("rename",  { session = id, text = "fix-osc52" })       -- refusal: command.failed
command("create",  { repo = "/src/thing", branch = "feat/x", agent = "claude" })
command("task",    { number = 3, status = "done" })
command("theme",   { text = "tokyo-night" })
```

**Commands never block and never return a result.** They are accepted instantly
and their effect appears in a later snapshot. Work in flight is readable at
`talos.commands`, so you can draw it rather than leaving an unexplained gap:

```lua
for _, item in ipairs(talos.commands) do
  -- item.kind, item.session, item.subject, item.host, item.phase, item.error
end
```

This is not a limitation to work around. A plugin that could wait would be a
plugin that can freeze the interface on a slow git fetch or an unreachable SSH
host.

Two verbs reach outside your own rect:

```lua
command("message", { text = "nothing to undo" })              -- INFO in the band
command("message", { text = "no such host", level = "error" })
command("action",  { text = "help.open" })                    -- as its chord would
```

`message` puts a sentence in the message band. The band stays kernel-drawn —
your pane contributes to it as it contributes a pill or a binding, rather than
spending a row of its own on a message line. `level` is `info` (the default),
`success` or `error`, and anything else is refused rather than read as `info`: a
severity nobody badges renders as an ordinary message, which is a message nobody
notices.

`action` runs a declared action through the very handler a click on a `role =
"action:…"` node runs, so a **key handler** can open help, settings, themes or
the palette. Before it, those were reachable only by painting a node and waiting
for a click — which is why three floats rebuilt a modal shell of their own.

The action goes to whichever plugin declared it — as a key **or** as a chord-less
palette row in `commands` — so it is also how one pane asks another to act. An
action carries no argument; leave one in `store` first. The search strip asks the
terminal pane to scroll to a hit this way: it writes `store["terminal.reveal"]`
and runs `terminal.reveal`, a palette row the terminal pane declares.

## Floating panes and modals

```lua
floats = true,   -- declared once: this pane may float

render = function(ctx)
  if not state.open then return { type = "text", text = "" } end
  return { float = { width = 50, height = 30 }, type = "box", ... }
end,
```

`width`/`height` are percentages of the screen; `cols`/`rows` ask in cells and
win where both are given. A modal framing a list of a known length wants its
height in rows — sized by percentage its frame drifts away from its content as
the terminal grows.

```lua
{ float = { width = 60, rows = 18 }, ... }   -- v1's modals: 60% wide, height to fit
```

A modal is *open* on the frames it returns a `float` node, and closed on the
ones it does not. There is no open/close state for the kernel and your plugin to
disagree about. While it floats it takes every key — except the reserved ones,
so it can never trap the user, and except copy and paste, which have to work
from any pane.

A float is centred unless it names a point to open at:

```lua
{ float = { at = { x = hit.screen_x, y = hit.screen_y }, cols = 24, rows = 8 }, ... }
```

It opens with its top-left corner on that cell. Where that would run off the
screen it opens the other way — to the left of the point, or above it — and is
then held on screen, so a menu opened in the bottom-right corner is whole.

A float also owns the pointer: a press that misses it is swallowed rather than
reaching the pane it covers. Declare `on_outside(hit)` to be told about that
press — either button, `hit.id` nil, `hit.screen_x`/`screen_y` set — which is how
a menu closes on a click elsewhere. The press is swallowed either way, so closing
a menu never also selects the row beneath it; a float that declares no
`on_outside` behaves exactly as before.

## Decorating another pane

```lua
decorates = "sessions",

decorate = function(tree)
  local t = require("lib.tree")
  return t.restyle(tree, function(node) return node.role == "row" end,
                   { fg = theme.accent, bold = true })
end,
```

You receive another plugin's rendered tree and return a modified one, matching
on the `id`/`class`/`role` nodes carry. This is how search highlights matches
inside panes it does not own. A decorator that throws costs its decoration, not
the pane.

## Turning a plugin off

`space` in the Interface tab turns the selected plugin off, and on again. The
file is not touched: it stays exactly where it is and is simply not loaded. That
is the thing to reach for when you want a pane gone for an afternoon, when you
are bisecting a problem, or when a plugin you are writing has broken the
interface — turning it off is enough to get a working one back, and for a pane you
wrote it is the *only* way back, since `r` has no shipped copy to restore
([When something goes wrong](#when-something-goes-wrong)).

**`d` is not that.** It deletes. For a file talos ships that is recoverable
(`r` writes the shipped copy back); for **a file you wrote there is no copy**,
and the removal is permanent. The confirmation says which one you are about to
do — read it.

A disabled plugin is genuinely absent, not dormant: it declares no keys, offers
no settings, occupies no slot and is granted no capability. Two things follow
that are worth knowing. Its key is **free** while it is off, so another plugin
may claim it — and turning the first one back on can then surface a conflict that
did not exist. And a **broken** disabled plugin reports nothing, because nothing
tried to load it; its error reappears when you turn it on.

## Running a program

A pane over `git status`, `docker compose ps` or `npm outdated` needs to *run*
those, and Lua here has no process, no filesystem and no network. `run` is the
one door, and it opens only for a plugin that asks for it and that you have
trusted.

```lua
capabilities = { "run" },          -- declare it, or `run` is not a function

render = function(ctx)
  if not run then                 -- absent until you are trusted; draw that
    return needs_trust(ctx)
  end
  run("status", "git status --porcelain", { session = id, ttl = 2 })
  local got = (talos.runs or {}).status
  if got and got.state == "done" and got.ok then
    -- got.stdout, got.stderr, got.status, got.truncated, got.timed_out
  end
end,
```

**Ask on every frame.** `run` does nothing while the answer is fresh *or while a
run for that key is already going*, so asking is a map lookup rather than a
process — and asking once, somewhere clever, is how a pane ends up showing
yesterday's answer forever. The in-flight half matters for a program slower than
its own `ttl`: without it every frame after the answer went stale would start
another copy. `refresh = true` overrides freshness; that is what a "reload" key
does.

**Trusting a plugin** is settings (`Ctrl+,`) → `]` → select it → `t`. The
Interface tab shows which files ask to run programs, which are trusted, and
whether a trusted file has changed since you trusted it. Revoking takes effect on
the next frame.

This is not a sandbox and does not pretend to be one. A program talos runs for
you has your authority, and no gate here changes that — what trust buys is that
nothing runs *unasked*, per plugin, revocably. Treat a plugin you did not write
the way you would treat a shell profile someone sent you.

**The kernel's bounds**, which a plugin cannot raise: output is capped per stream
and flagged when truncated, a run times out (30 s by default, `timeout = n` up to
ten minutes), and four run at once with the rest queued. A run happens in the
session's working directory, and for a remote session **on that session's host** —
which is what makes `docker compose ps` mean the right containers.

## Running a program you interact with

`run` captures a program's output once. It has no stdin and no terminal, so it
cannot give you `htop`, `lazygit`, a REPL or a log you page through. For those a
pane holds a **real terminal**: keystrokes go to the program, it is resized to the
rect, and it keeps running while you work elsewhere.

```lua
capabilities = { "program" },      -- a DIFFERENT capability from `run`
focusable = true,                  -- or it can never be typed at
input = "session",                 -- keys you do not handle go to the surface

render = function(ctx)
  if not talos.granted.program then
    return needs_trust(ctx)        -- absent until you are trusted; draw that
  end
  -- Every frame. Asking for a pane you already have is a map lookup, not a
  -- second copy of the program.
  command("program", { text = "watch", repo = "htop", args = { "-d", "10" } })
  return { type = "surface", program = "watch", fill = 1 }
end,
```

The pane is **yours**, not a session's: one instance whatever is selected. You write
its name and the kernel supplies the owner, so two plugins can both call their pane
`watch` and get two different programs — and neither can name the other's.

`repo` is the program and `args` its arguments, kept separate because the
multiplexer quotes each one: a path with a space in it survives that and would not
survive being concatenated into a command line.

Give one up with `command("program", { text = "watch", action = "close" })`. A
plugin that is removed, renamed or turned off has its panes released for it.

**Telling a running program something.** Starting is idempotent, so asking again
with different `args` does nothing — the pane is already there. To change what a
long-lived program is showing, type at it from any interactive hook —
`on_key`, `on_action`, `on_click`, `on_context`, `on_outside`, `on_scroll`, or
`on_event`
(not from `render`, or it will be re-typed every frame):

```lua
command("program", { text = "editor", keys = ":e " .. path .. "\r" })
```

The bytes reach the program's stdin exactly as if they had been typed, so `\r`
is Enter and `\27` is Escape. On tmux, because a Lua string is bytes, a sequence
that is not UTF-8 arrives as written; on native Windows, non-UTF-8 bytes are
lossy-decoded (`String::from_utf8_lossy`) before they are sent. `text` names the
pane and nothing is started. This
is what makes an editor pane worth keeping: opening a second file is a line typed
at the editor you have, not a second one paid for from scratch. It is refused,
and reported, when no program of that name is running, and when a running one
cannot take the bytes — more sends in one frame than its input holds refuses the
rest as a full input channel. It needs the same `program` capability starting one
does, since driving a live process is the same privilege as beginning it.

Every refusal of a `program` command reaches `command.failed` with `kind =
"program"`, the pane's name as `subject`, and the reason as `error`.

**Type it, or start it.** Send `keys` *and* a program and the kernel picks: the
keys go to a pane that is running, and a pane that is not is started from `repo`
and `args` instead, which is expected to leave it in the state the keys were for.
A running pane that refuses the keys is reported, never started over.

```lua
command("program", {
  text = "editor",
  repo = "nvim",
  args = { path },                    -- if it has to be started
  keys = ":e " .. path .. "\r",       -- if it is already there
})
```

Do not try to make this decision in the plugin. Whether a pane is alive is not in
the snapshot, and a plugin that kept the answer in its own `state` would be wrong
after an interface reload, which keeps panes but re-runs the file. The kernel is
asking the pane. The keys are **not** sent to a program it just started: a process
that has not begun reading yet would lose them.

**Learning that it ended.** A program that exits leaves its pane holding a
finished screen; the kernel does not reap it, because asking again is what
restarts it. Subscribe to know:

```lua
events = { "program.exited" },

on_event = function(name, payload)
  if name == "program.exited" then       -- payload.name, payload.program
    state.showing = nil                  -- draw something else, or move on
  end
end,
```

It fires once, on the transition, and only for **your** panes.

**Why `talos.granted` and not `if not program then`.** A capability is normally
withheld by *absence* — that is rule 4, and it is why `run` is simply not a
function until you are trusted. A program pane is asked for through `command`,
which every plugin has, so absence cannot express it: without `granted` a pane
could not tell "you have not trusted me" from "still starting". It grants nothing;
it reports a decision you already made.

**Why it is not `run`'s grant.** `run` is bounded on every axis that matters —
capped output, a timeout, four at a time. An interactive program has none of those
by design, and holds your keyboard as well. Trusting a pane to poll `top` every few
seconds is not the same decision as letting it hold a process open on your
keystrokes, so it is asked separately. The Interface tab says which of the two a
file wants.

**Bounds.** Four panes per plugin — the same number as `run`'s concurrency, so
there is one to remember. `run`'s others do not transfer: an output cap is
meaningless for a screen overwritten in place, and a timeout is the opposite of what
an interactive program wants.

**Lifetime.** Reloading (`F10`) keeps the program running — a reload is an edit to
a file, and losing your editor to one would make reloading unusable. Quitting
leaves it running; the next launch finds it again by its window name, so nothing is
persisted that could go stale. A program that exits on its own is *reported* as
exited rather than drawn as a frozen screen, and asking again starts it afresh.

**Local only, for now.** A plugin's pane has no session and therefore no host, so
it runs on this machine in the interface directory. `run` goes remote because a
session tells it where to; there is nothing here to ask.

## Reserved keys

`ctrl+q` quit · `f10` reload · `ctrl+h` / `ctrl+l` move focus · `f12` perf counters.

These cannot be rebound or consumed, so a misbehaving plugin can never leave the
user stuck inside it.

**`tab` is not among them**, deliberately. Every coding agent uses it for completion,
and a full-screen program in a pane needs it too — an automap, a pager, `vim`. So it
reaches your pane, and a plugin may claim it (the creation flow does). This list used
to name `tab` as moving focus, which was never true and cost a plugin author real
time; focus has only ever moved on `ctrl+h`/`ctrl+l`.

**A disabled plugin reports nothing.** Its keys are free while it is off — another
plugin may claim one, and turning the first back on can then surface a conflict
that did not exist. And a broken one shows no error, because nothing tried to
load it; the error reappears when you turn it on.

**A run is not a stream.** It completes, then reports. Watching `docker logs -f`
is what the shell pane (`Ctrl+T`) is for — it is a real terminal, in the session's
directory, on the session's machine.

**A plugin must handle not being trusted.** The capability is *absent*, not
refusing: `run` is nil, so `command`-style error handling never fires. Check for
it and draw something useful, as `examples/lua/composite.lua` does — that state
is the first thing every user of your plugin will see.

## When something goes wrong

- A plugin that fails to load leaves the **last good version running**, with the
  error on screen.
- A plugin that throws while rendering shows a red panel **in its own rect**.
- A plugin that never returns is **interrupted** — an unterminated loop costs one
  pane, not the application.
- A plugin that allocates without bound hits a **memory ceiling** and fails.
- If your whole plugin directory will not load, the **embedded copies** run
  instead, so you can fix the file from inside the thing it broke.

### Settings → Interface: the way back

`Ctrl+,` (or `F6`), then `]`. It is **chrome, not a pane** — a recovery tool that
was itself a plugin could be the thing that is broken, so nothing you do to the
directory can take it away. It lists every file the interface is made of, what
state that file is in and where it came from; the header line is the directory in
force, which is the answer to "my edits did nothing" — they are usually edits to a
file that is not the one loaded.

Rows are **grouped** — `PANES`, then `LAYOUT` (`layout.lua`, `plugins.toml`),
`MODULES` and `DOCS` — and **trouble sorts to the top** of each group, so a failure
never sits below thirty healthy rows. Each row carries one word of state, then where
its trust stands, then where it came from when that is not "shipped, unchanged"
(`edited`, `yours`, `from <package>`):

| | State | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `✗` | `failed` | on disk, did not load. Select the row and the **error is under the list** |
| `⊘` | `deleted` | talos ships it, you deleted it, delivery has stopped writing it |
| `◌` | `not placed` | it loaded, and `layout.lua` places nothing in its slot — so it never draws |
| `◍` | `off` | present and intact, deliberately not loaded |
| `●` | `on screen` | drawing now |
| `◐` | `on demand` | a float or a modal, at rest |
| `○` | `hidden` | its slot is placed, but another pane holds it or its column is closed |
| `·` | `on require`, `in use`, `guide`, `decorates` | not a pane with a slot of its own: a `lib/` module, the layout or manifest, a doc, a decorator |

Under the list, four lines explain the **selected** row: what it is (and the slot a
pane wants) with its full source; why it is in that state; the one thing that
changes it — for a pane that is not placed, the exact `{ slot = "…" }` line to add to
`layout.lua`; and, for a file that declares capabilities, what it asks to do and
whether that is granted.

Four keys act on the selected row, and the footer lists only the ones that do
something there:

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| `r` | **restore** — write the copy talos ships back over the file. On an edited file it asks first and says what is lost: nothing keeps a pane's edits, and an edited `layout.lua` is moved to `layout.lua.bak`. A deleted file comes back on the first press |
| `space` | **turn off / turn on** — the file is untouched, simply not loaded |
| `d` | **delete** — asked twice, and the confirmation says whether it can be undone |
| `t` | **trust** / **revoke** — grant or withdraw the capabilities the file declares |

Each of the four reloads the interface, so the result is on screen immediately
rather than at the next start, and each says what it did.

### What `r` can put back, and what it cannot

`r` means "put back what talos ships, and forget what happened to this file",
which is why it covers both undo cases for a shipped pane — an edit and a
deletion. It has **nothing to put back for a file talos never shipped**, and it
says so rather than doing something. So which recovery you have depends on where
the file came from, and the row's own tail is what tells you:

| The row shows | The file is | The way back |
|---|---|---|
| no tail at all | a bundled pane, as shipped | `r`, though there is nothing to undo |
| `edited` | a bundled pane you changed | `r` — the shipped copy is in the binary |
| `removed` | a bundled pane you deleted | `r` |
| `yours` | one you wrote | **`space`**, then fix the file. `r` reports that talos ships no version of it |
| `from <src>` | an installed pane | `talos-cli plugin sync` — the manager that put it there puts it back. `r` says so and refuses |

A pane you wrote yourself is therefore the one case with no restore, and `space`
is what you reach for: turning it off is enough to get a working interface back
while you fix it, and it is also how you bisect which of several files is at
fault. Remember that **a disabled plugin reports nothing** — nothing tried to
load it, so its error reappears only when you turn it back on.

`layout.lua` and the `lib/` modules are the files whose mistakes cost the whole
screen rather than one pane; both are ordinary rows here, and both are restorable
with `r` while they are the ones talos shipped. If the *whole* directory will
not load, the embedded copies are already running — so you are fixing the file
from inside a working interface, not from a blank one.

### The same answers without a terminal

- `talos-cli plugin list` — the inventory above, as text.
- `talos-cli plugin dir` — the directory in force, and which rule chose it.
- `talos-cli plugin check` — loads the interface the way `talos` does and
  exits non-zero on a failure, including on a pane that loaded but which no
  arrangement places (it prints the `layout.lua` line to add).

None of the three starts a TUI, which is what makes them the tools for a coding
agent, a CI check, or a terminal you cannot currently trust.

### Two bigger hammers

- **Delete `.bundled.json`** and the next start re-delivers every bundled file,
  forgetting which ones you had removed. Your own files are untouched.
- **Delete the whole directory** for the shipped interface exactly as it ships.

Neither touches `ui.json`, which lives beside the directory rather than in it: a
pane you turned off is still off after both, and a trust you granted is still
recorded. If a decision is what you want to undo, undo it in the Interface tab.

## Examples you can install

Two example panes under `examples/panes/`, neither of them bundled, plus two more under
`examples/lua/` you copy by hand. They exist because "every pane is a file" is
easier to believe from a pane you added yourself than from prose.

**They are examples, not a catalogue.** They are here to be read and copied from,
not a set talos maintains on your behalf — installing one is a convenience over
`cp`, and it becomes yours the moment you edit it. For panes meant to be *used*
rather than read, see [Panes that give a v1 surface back](#panes-that-give-a-v1-surface-back)
below.

| Example | What it is |
|---|---|
| `tasks` | v1's tasks pane, rebuilt as a plugin. Reads `talos.tasks`, writes `task` commands, needs no capability |
| `top` | CPU, memory and load as gauges, parsed from `top`. Asks for `run`, so it needs your trust |

| Example file | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`plugin.lua`](../examples/lua/plugin.lua) | what `plugin new` writes: a pane, a key, a setting |
| [`composite.lua`](../examples/lua/composite.lua) | the worked `run` example — git status and log, on the session's own host |
| [`events.lua`](../examples/lua/events.lua) | the worked `on_event` example — selects a session the moment it blocks, with a palette command to switch it off |
| [`layout.lua`](../examples/lua/layout.lua) | an arrangement putting the two panes above in a column beside the agent |

Together they are one demo:

```bash
talos-cli plugin install tasks
talos-cli plugin install top
cp examples/lua/layout.lua ~/.config/talos/ui/layout.lua
```

Each install prints the `layout.lua` line the pane needs, because a pane whose slot
nothing places loads cleanly and draws nothing. Press `F10`, then trust
`85_top.lua` (settings → Interface → `t`) so it may run a program — installing a
plugin grants it nothing.

`layout.lua` **replaces** the shipped arrangement — delete yours afterwards and the
Interface tab restores it, so there is nothing here you cannot undo. It is copied
rather than installed on purpose: the manager never writes your arrangement (see
below).

Two things they are chosen to show. `tasks.lua` draws the `input` node kind, which
is the one of the four nothing bundled uses. And `top.lua` reads the machine **the
selected session runs on**, because `run` executes in that session's directory on
that session's host — so moving the cursor onto a session over SSH shows the remote
box's load, with nothing in the plugin knowing what SSH is.

`layout.lua` is the half people forget: adding a pane is two edits, the plugin and
the slot. Both panes name a slot of their own, and a slot no arrangement places is
a pane that loads and never draws. `plugin check` **fails** on exactly that and
prints the line to add, so it is caught rather than puzzled over:

```console
$ talos-cli plugin check
  ✓ loads — sessions, agent, confirm, search, new_session, tasks
  ✗ plugins/80_tasks.lua — loaded, but nothing places slot "tasks"
      add it to layout.lua's children: { slot = "tasks" }
  (checked at 200x50)
```

The size is reported because placement depends on it — the shipped arrangement
drops the session column below 80 columns — so "unplaced" only means anything at a
size where the slot should have been placed. Floats need no slot and disabled panes
were never asked for, so neither is reported.

**The quieter sibling: sharing a `switch` slot.** A slot in switch mode shows one
occupant and keeps the rest as alternates, so a pane that is not first draws nothing
until it is focused. Unlike an unplaced slot this fails no check — it loads, it is
placed, `plugin list` says `installed`, and the user's screen is unchanged. It is the
one install that cannot demonstrate itself, and the person it fools is whoever followed
your README.

So **declare a pill**. The action band is kernel chrome and enumerates pills as declared
data, without invoking anything, which makes it the only advertisement that is
automatic — the tab strip beside the agent's views is that *plugin's* own chrome and
cannot carry a third occupant:

```lua
pills = { { action = "mine.open", label = "Mine", priority = 10 } },
```

A low `priority` is right for anything optional: the band drops the least important
entries first when it runs out of width, and orders left to right by the same number.
`plugin check` **warns** about a pane in this state, and `plugin install` says it at the
moment you install one — but it does not fail either, because you may have meant it.

**The number you declare is a default, not the last word.** Whoever installs your pane
can reorder the band from the `pills` section of their own `~/.config/talos/ui.json`,
so they never have to edit a file you ship:

```json
{
  "pills": { "mine.open": 75 }
}
```

An entry is keyed by the pill's `action`, so a reader lists only the buttons they moved
and every other pill keeps what its plugin declared; deleting the entry gives yours back.
The section is read at startup, beside `bindings` and `settings`, and what it cannot do
is invent a button — a priority names a pill that already exists and nothing else. That
is the same standard the band holds your own declaration to: it draws a pill only when a
**key** resolves for its action, so a pill pointing at a palette-only `commands` entry is
dropped exactly like one naming nothing. Give the action a key as well.

The drop stays — a chip that lights on hover and then does nothing costs a press to
discover — but it is not silent: `plugin check` reports every pill the band dropped, and
says which of the two mistakes it was, because an action the palette can reach and a
misspelt one look identical from the outside.

```console
$ talos-cli plugin check
  ✓ loads — …, notes
  ! plugins/90_notes.lua — pill "Notes" is not drawn: "notes.open" is a command with no key, …
  ! plugins/90_notes.lua — pill "Memory" is not drawn: nothing loaded declares "notes.opne" — …
```

A warning rather than a failure, like the switch-slot case above: the pane still loads
and still draws, and what is missing is one button.

**Quieter still: a chord somebody else already spent.** Two global claims on
one chord both load and both are placed, and one of them simply never fires — the
earlier declaration keeps the key, or a user's rebinding does. Inside your own
interface that is yours to notice; a *published* pane cannot know which keys its
users have spent — the code-review pane below takes `Ctrl+X` and `F7` because both
are free in the interface talos ships, which says nothing about yours. So
`plugin check` reports it, with both claimants and the one that wins:

```console
$ talos-cli plugin check
  ✓ loads — sessions, agent, confirm, search, new_session, restore, notes, scratch
  ! plugins/91_scratch.lua — f7 is claimed by both notes.toggle and scratch.toggle; notes.toggle wins (declared in plugins/90_notes.lua)
```

A warning, like the missing pill and for the same reason — two authors wanting one
chord is a judgement call, and the user can settle it by rebinding either action in
the settings panel. The kernel's own chords are in the same registry, so a pane that
takes `F1` is reported against `kernel` rather than against a file. A chord claimed
in two *plugin* scopes is not a conflict at all: focus decides, which is why three
bundled panes can each bind `j`.

## Panes that give a v1 surface back

Two of the surfaces v2 dropped are maintained as panes, each in its own repository
rather than in the interface directory talos ships. They are not examples: they are
what a plugin looks like when it has to carry v1's behaviour, and they are the answer
to "code review is gone" and "the info panel is gone".

| Pane | What it gives back |
|---|---|
| [`talos-code-review`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-code-review) | v1's diff reviewer — the branch, a commit or the working changes, a changed-files tree, notes you send back to the agent. Reclaims `Ctrl+X` / `F7` |
| [`talos-info-panel`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-info-panel) | v1's info panel — session, git, agent, usage and system readouts in a column beside the terminal. Reclaims `F2` |

Both carry more than one file, so both install by **cloning** the repository
([A plugin that carries more than Lua](#a-plugin-that-carries-more-than-lua)):

```bash
talos-cli plugin install git+https://github.com/zatzk/talos-code-review
talos-cli plugin install git+https://github.com/zatzk/talos-info-panel
```

They differ in the two ways that matter here, which is most of why they are worth
reading:

- **Placement.** The review pane takes the `center` switch slot beside the agent and
  declares a pill, so it needs no `layout.lua` edit and the action band advertises it
  the moment it is installed — the switch-slot problem above, solved the way that
  section says to solve it. The info panel is a column, so it needs its one line in
  `layout.lua`, and its README carries the `max` that stops a label-and-value panel
  being handed a third of a wide screen.
- **Capabilities.** The info panel asks for **nothing**: every readout is in the
  snapshot, including the metrics the kernel gathers on its own workers. The review
  pane asks for `run`, and only for the two targets the kernel does not compute (the
  uncommitted working changes, and a single commit) — untrusted it still draws the
  kernel's `talos.diffs`, and the target picker names the choices it cannot serve
  rather than hiding them. That is the shape to copy for an optional capability.

The third missing surface, the file viewer, has no pane — by nobody having written
one rather than by anything withheld: `files.list/read` is published, rooted at a
session's directory.

## Managing panes

Composition is written down, in `plugins.toml` beside your panes:

```toml
# what this interface is made of
[[plugin]]
src  = "top"                    # a bare name, a URL, or a path
file = "plugins/85_top.lua"     # load order lives in the filename
pin  = "v2.1.0"                 # omit to take the newest at install time
```

TOML because that is what every hand-edited registry here is, and because a bad
edit is a parse error naming its line rather than a nil three frames later. A bare
name resolves to `examples/panes/<name>` in the talos repository at **this binary's
release tag**, the same rule `extension install <name>` follows against
`extensions/<name>` — a pane reads `talos.*`, which is a contract that moves, so
what a bare name fetches matches the binary asking for it. (For extensions the
rule currently resolves to nothing: `extensions/` holds only the two built-ins,
which install themselves. Panes are where bare names still have something to
reach.) Bare names reach the *examples*; anything you
actually depend on is better named by a URL, a path, or a repository you control.

That tag is also why a bare name can stop resolving: the examples lived under
`ui-plugins/` before they moved to `examples/panes/`, so a `plugins.lock` written
by a binary from before the move records a tag whose tree has no `examples/panes/`
and `plugin sync` reports the pane as not found. Re-run `talos-cli plugin install
<name>` to re-lock it at the current tag, or name a URL or a path in
`plugins.toml` instead — which is the same advice as the paragraph above, for the
same reason.

### A plugin that carries more than Lua

A pane that runs a program needs that program, and a pane with data needs the data.
Neither can arrive as text: the file-by-file path returns a `String` and decodes
remote output lossily, so a binary through it is **corrupted rather than refused**.

So a plugin with a payload is a **repository**, and installing it clones it:

```bash
talos-cli plugin install git+https://github.com/you/talos-widget
```

Everything the repository holds arrives, in the layout you chose — Lua in whatever
directories suit it, a program, a data file. Three forms are recognised as a
repository, all of them explicit: a `git+` prefix, a `.git` suffix, or
`git@host:path`. A bare `https://…` URL deliberately does **not** clone, because
that spelling already means "fetch the manifest's files from this base" and
reinterpreting it by hostname would change what every existing install does.

The working copy lands at `<interface dir>/<name>/`, and **keeps its `.git`**. That
is what makes `update` a fetch rather than a re-download, and it is what protects
your edits: git refuses to move a dirty working tree, so a `sync` over a pane you
changed reports `kept` and leaves it alone. `git diff` shows what you changed and
`git checkout` undoes it — better than any restore we could offer for a file we
never shipped.

That protection cuts both ways, and it is the trap for a pane that *generates*
anything — which is to say, exactly the pane this whole capability invites. A pane that
runs a program is the pane tempted to build one. **Never write inside your own working
copy.** A build artefact, a
downloaded engine, a cache — anything you produce there makes the tree dirty, and a
dirty tree is exactly what makes `update` report `kept` and refuse to move. Keeping
your working copy clean is not tidiness; it is what keeps your plugin updatable. Put
what you generate in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/<your-plugin>/` (or `~/.cache/<your-plugin>/`),
outside the interface directory entirely — which the next paragraph is also the reason
for.

The spec entry names the pane inside the working copy:

```toml
[[plugin]]
src  = "git+https://github.com/you/talos-widget"
file = "talos-widget/plugins/40_widget.lua"
```

You rarely write that by hand — `install` finds it, taking the single `.lua` in the
repository's `plugins/` directory, and asks for `--as plugins/<file>` when there is
more than one. Its place in the load order still comes from the `40_` prefix, so
where a plugin came from does not change where it sits. Its own modules are
requirable by path: `require("talos-widget.lib.util")`.

The lock records the **commit**, not the branch. `main` moves; a commit does not, so
the same spec and lock reproduce the same bytes on another machine. That is also why
there is no checksum field to maintain: the commit already identifies every byte, and
it is produced by the source rather than transcribed by hand.

`--pin` takes any of the three, and which one you give decides what `update` does:

| `--pin` | what you get | what `update` does |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | the default branch's tip | follows it |
| a branch | that branch's tip | follows that branch |
| a tag | the tag | stays |
| a commit — the **full** object id | that commit | stays |

A pin is a pin: `update` on a tagged or committed entry reports `current` rather
than moving it, so pinning is how you hold a plugin still. Pinning a commit is what
`--pin` is *for* — it is what the lock writes — and it is worth knowing that `git
clone --branch` cannot do it: a commit is fetched and checked out after the clone.
You get one shallow round trip either way; a pin that cannot be obtained fails with
git's own message and leaves nothing behind.

Give that commit **in full** — 40 characters of sha1, or 64 of sha256. A remote
serves branches, tags and whole objects and never a prefix of one, so the
abbreviation `git log` prints reaches nothing, and the failure says so rather than
blaming a rebase. A tag or branch whose *name* happens to be hex (`20240115`) is a
name like any other and still installs — only the remote can tell the two apart —
unless it is exactly an object id's length, where git reads the id it parses as
and asks for that object rather than for the name.

**Installing a plugin from a repository puts that repository's files on your disk,
executable bits included.** That is what cloning anything does. What it does *not*
do is run any of it: nothing executes at install time, and a program still needs the
`program` capability you grant per file. Treat a repository you did not write the way
you would treat one you were about to `make` in.

**Picking the right build.** `talos.platform` gives you `os` and `arch`, so a
plugin shipping several binaries chooses for itself:

```lua
local p = talos.platform
local exe = talos.ui_dir .. "/talos-widget/bin/" .. p.os .. "-" .. p.arch .. "/widget"
```

Deliberately not a manifest field. A substitution template states one rule; a pane
that reads its platform states every rule it actually needs — prefer something
already on `PATH`, fall back to a portable build, distinguish a libc variant, or draw
an honest "nothing here for this machine".

**Do not build under the interface directory.** It is watched *recursively*, so an
`npm install` or a compile there fires thousands of events. `.git` is filtered;
a plugin's own build tree is not, and filtering every possible one is not a rule worth
having — the rule is "build somewhere else". The symptom if you ignore this is the
counter-intuitive one: a burst of events keeps the reload debounce rolling forward, so
the interface does not reload too often, it **stops reloading at all** while you are
busy. A pane that fetches or builds its own engine on first run is exactly the case
that tempts you into it.

**Key releases do not reach a program pane.** talos asks its own terminal only for
`DISAMBIGUATE_ESCAPE_CODES`, not `REPORT_EVENT_TYPES`, and the loop handles
`KeyEventKind::Press` alone — so a program that distinguishes press from release
(anything using the kitty keyboard protocol's `CSI > 3 u`) sees presses only, and a
held key latches. Nothing a plugin can do about it; it needs a change in the kernel.
Worth knowing before you build a pane whose program wants held keys.

**If you publish one:** shipping a program under a copyleft licence obliges your
repository to carry that program's corresponding source. That is your obligation, not
talos's, but the mechanism invites it. URLs and filesystem paths work too,
and a URL ending in `.lua` installs that single file (with `--as` naming where it
lands).

Beside it, `plugins.lock` records what each entry resolved to and the digest of
every file delivered. You hand-edit the spec; nothing hand-edits the lock. Commit
both and the same interface reproduces elsewhere.

```bash
talos-cli plugin install <src> [--as FILE] [--pin V]  # and record it
talos-cli plugin sync                                 # make the directory match the spec
talos-cli plugin update [name]                        # advance a pin, when you ask
talos-cli plugin remove <name>                        # file, spec entry and record
talos-cli plugin available                            # what installs by bare name
```

`sync` is the one to reach for after editing the spec by hand, and it is the one an
agent wants: **edit one file, run one command, read the exit status.** It installs
what is missing, takes back what you removed from the spec, and leaves everything
else alone — including a pane the spec never listed, which is nobody's to touch.
Running it twice changes nothing.

Three rules it will not break, all of them the ones delivery already follows:

- **An edit is yours.** A managed file you changed is preserved and reported as
  `kept`, never overwritten — even when the source has moved on.
- **A deletion is remembered.** Delete a managed pane and `sync` leaves it deleted.
  That is how you remove one.
- **Your arrangement is yours.** Nothing here writes `layout.lua`. Editing Lua is
  what a coding agent is good at; noticing that a pane silently is not drawing is
  what it cannot do, so the effort went into `check` instead.

`sync` resolves each entry at the version the **lock** recorded, not at whatever is
newest — that is what makes it reproducible. Moving forward is `update`, asked for
explicitly, which reports what moved and from where. An entry the spec *pins* is
already where you said it should be, so `update` leaves it and says `already
current`; moving that one means editing the pin and running `sync`.

### Trust for a pane you did not write

`run` is granted per file, so where a file came from is the question to answer
before granting it. The Interface tab says: a pane from a source reads
`from <package>` rather than `yours`, with the full source under the list when it
is selected, and a `lib/<name>/` module a package brought is traced to it too.

The grant itself is recorded against the **source and version** it was made for,
not against the file's contents alone:

| `src@version` | contents | reads as |
|---|---|---|
| matches | match | `trusted` — including a reinstall |
| differs | — | not granted; you are asked again |
| matches | differ | `installed · modified` |

Both halves matter. Recording only the contents would report every ordinary release
as tampering and teach you to dismiss the warning. Recording only `src@version`
would let a source re-tag the same version with something else and keep a
capability you granted to what that version used to be. That last row is the one to
notice — it is the same warning as a local edit, because from outside they are
indistinguishable.

### There is no lazy loading

The Neovim package managers this borrows from make it the headline feature. Here it
would optimise nothing: a disabled plugin is never read, an unplaced pane never
renders, and the bundled set is 19 files. A load scheduler would add machinery and
a new class of "why is my pane missing".
