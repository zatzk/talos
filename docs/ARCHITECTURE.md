# Architecture Decisions

Each decision follows a mini-ADR format:
**Choice**, **Why**, **Rejected alternatives**.

---

## ADR-1: The Elm Architecture (TEA)

> **Superseded by ADR-23.** This described v1's interface, which was retired when
> the plugin kernel took the `talos` binary name. The reasoning below is why the
> kernel keeps a single source of truth and one direction of data flow — reads are
> snapshots, writes are commands — rather than letting each pane own state. v1 is
> maintained on the `v1.x` branch.

**Choice**: All state lives in a single `App` model.
Events become messages, `update()` applies them,
`view()` renders the result.

**Why**: TEA makes state transitions explicit and testable.
Every input has a traceable path from event to screen change.
There's no hidden state scattered across components, which matters
when multiple PTY sessions are producing concurrent output.

**Rejected**:

- *Component-based (each panel owns state)* — leads to
  synchronization bugs when sessions interact.
- *Ad-hoc event handlers* — untraceable control flow;
  hard to reason about as the app grows.

---

## ADR-2: Session pipeline — SessionBackend + vt100 + tui-term

**Choice**: A `SessionBackend` trait abstracts session lifecycle
(spawn, adopt, resize, kill, detach, discover). Each session runs
one coding-agent CLI inside the backend. The default backend is
the platform's multiplexer run locally (`tmux -L talos`; psmux on native
Windows), and the same adapters run over SSH or WSL for a host (ADR-13).
`vt100::Parser` interprets escape sequences,
`tui_term::PseudoTerminal` renders the parsed screen into ratatui.

**Why**: The trait-based design keeps the multiplexer behind a clean
boundary so no consumer touches tmux directly (ADR-11). tmux provides truly persistent sessions
that survive talos crashes/restarts, multiple talos instances
share the same running sessions, and external recovery is
possible via `tmux -L talos attach`.

**Previous design**: `portable-pty` spawned the agent CLI
directly. Sessions died when talos exited, terminal content was
lost on restart, and multiple instances had no coordination.

**Rejected**:

- *`portable-pty` (previous)* — no session persistence,
  no multi-instance sharing, terminal content lost on restart.
- *`alacritty_terminal`* — full terminal emulator,
  far heavier than needed.
- *Parsing raw ANSI ourselves* — error-prone,
  massive surface area, already solved by `vt100`.

---

## ADR-3: Async — tokio multi-threaded + spawn_blocking

**Choice**: The app runs on tokio's multi-threaded runtime.
PTY read loops run inside `spawn_blocking`
(blocking I/O in a threadpool), while PTY write and event handling
run in `tokio::spawn` (async).

**Why**: PTY reads are blocking by nature
(`read()` on a file descriptor). Putting them in `spawn_blocking`
prevents stalling the async executor. The writer side is naturally
async — it awaits messages from an mpsc channel
and writes when they arrive.

**Generalized off-the-hot-path pattern**: the same
`spawn_blocking` → `mpsc` → poll-in-`tick()` shape keeps every other
blocking side effect off the UI thread, so neither rendering nor
`Ctrl+N` ever freezes. Each operation owns an in-flight guard + result
receiver on `App`, kicks off the blocking work, and applies the result
when `tick()` polls `try_recv()`:

- **Worktree sync** (`Ctrl+S`) — `git rebase` per worktree
  (`worktree_sync_rx`, the original instance of the pattern).
- **Per-tick metrics** — `refresh_system_metrics` (sysinfo + statusline
  file reads + the active pane's PID lookup) and `refresh_active_git_stats`
  (`git` diff/status shell-outs). The `sysinfo::System` is *moved into*
  the worker and returned with the result so CPU deltas persist across
  refreshes; a single in-flight guard prevents overlap.
- **Existing-worktree discovery** — `git::list_worktrees_on`
  (`git worktree list --porcelain`) for the repo the picker's cursor is
  on, served by `RepoStore::request_worktrees` on its own thread and
  published as `talos.worktrees`. No `git fetch`, unlike the branch
  list: a worktree is local state and the read happens on a keypress.
- **Interactive spawn** — `git worktree add` (`spawn_worktree_session`)
  and the multiplexer window creation (500 ms+) for the
  new-session wizard run on blocking tasks, with the follow-up
  (session adoption, task-prompt delivery) carried in a `Pending*`
  continuation applied on completion. Programmatic spawns
  (automations/tasks, restore) stay **synchronous** — they read the new
  session's id straight back, so they cannot defer it to a later tick.

**Rejected**:

- *Single-threaded tokio* — PTY reads would block the entire
  runtime, freezing the UI.
- *`std::thread` for everything* — works but loses tokio's
  structured concurrency, select!, and channel ergonomics.

---

## ADR-4: Input translation — crossterm KeyCode to xterm ANSI

**Choice**: `input.rs` maps crossterm `KeyCode`/`KeyModifiers`
to raw xterm ANSI byte sequences before writing to the PTY.

**Why**: crossterm gives us structured key events.
PTYs expect raw bytes. The translation layer is explicit and
testable — each key has a known byte sequence, and edge cases
(arrow keys, function keys, modifier combos)
are handled in one place.

**Rejected**:

- *Raw passthrough (forward crossterm's raw bytes)* —
  crossterm's internal byte representation doesn't match xterm
  sequences. Modifier keys, in particular, would break.

### An image on the clipboard is the agent's paste, not ours

talos's clipboard transport carries text (`clipboard::copy`/`paste`, and the
OSC 52 leg by construction). An image therefore cannot be pasted here at all —
but the CLI in the pane can fetch one itself when it sees the paste chord, so
`Ctrl+V` is **handed to it** rather than swallowed. `kernel.paste` declines the
chord, the same `Some(false)` answer `kernel.copy` uses when there is no
selection, and the press falls through to the focused terminal.

Inside WSL the decision cannot be made locally: WSLg bridges the clipboard's
*text* only, so while Windows holds an image the X clipboard still hands out the
last text copied — a paste there inserts something stale rather than nothing,
which is worse. `clipboard::ImageProbe` asks `powershell.exe`
(`Clipboard::ContainsImage`) instead. That costs ~0.42 s measured, which is why
it is the seventh instance of the worker pattern rather than a call on the loop:
the press is claimed immediately and acted on when the answer lands. Off WSL
nothing is asked — the local clipboard is the one being copied into, and
arboard's answer is the whole truth.

Three bounds make that latency safe. The **target** is the session the press was
aimed at, taken at the press: 0.42 s is long enough to change panes, and a paste
landing in a pane nobody aimed it at corrupts what is being typed there. **One
question runs at a time** — key auto-repeat makes presses tens of times faster
than the answer, and a `powershell.exe` per repeat is a held key bringing the
machine down — with the presses that arrive while it is out kept (at most eight)
and asked about separately, because an answer may only classify presses that
predate it. And the child has a **five-second deadline**, after which it is
killed and the press handed to the agent unanswered: WSL interop can wedge
outright, and the question after this one waits on its answer. A probe that was
killed is never read as "no image" — that reading is exactly the stale paste
this path exists to stop.

**Rejected**: *a second chord for "give the paste to the agent"* — cheap and
exact, but it leaves the ordinary `Ctrl+V` after copying an image still pasting
stale text, which is the half of the bug that corrupts a prompt silently.
*Resolving the focus when the answer lands* — it reads as "paste where the
person is looking", but the intent belongs to the press, and a paste that
arrives in a pane it was not aimed at is the same corruption seen from the other
side. *Spending one answer on every press waiting behind it* — the clipboard can
change while the question is out, and a press classified by what preceded it is
exactly the stale paste this section is about.
*Detecting the image with arboard* — talos builds it with
`default-features = false`, the build without `get_image`, and the X clipboard
it would read does not carry the Windows image anyway.

### A paste on Windows arrives as keys, not as a paste

`Event::Paste` is unix-only. crossterm's Windows source reads console
INPUT_RECORDs, and `EnableBracketedPaste` there is documented as unsupported
(`execute_winapi` returns `Unsupported`), so a paste into the TUI arrives as a
stream of key presses — every line break an `Enter` that talos forwarded to
the agent, which submitted the prompt one line at a time.

`coordinator::paste` turns that stream back into a paste before anything is
dispatched. Its shape is dictated by what the console actually delivers,
measured against the `ssh` → ConPTY path with a key dumper rather than assumed:

- **The bracketed-paste markers are gone.** The ConPTY strips `ESC[200~` /
  `ESC[201~` before the app sees them; a paste is plain `Char`/`Enter` events
  with no framing at all. There is nothing to match on, so there is no marker
  machinery.
- **Editing keys arrive whole.** An arrow key, `Delete`, `Ctrl+Delete`, a
  function key each arrive as their own `KeyEvent` (`KeyCode::Left`, …), not as
  a run of `ESC` `[` `…` character events.

So the only thing separating a paste from typing is **timing**, and two small
rules follow:

1. **Grouping is by the inter-key gap.** A plain character joins a run when it
   lands within 10 ms of the previous one; a person's fastest two keys stay
   well above that and a pasted stream runs far under it. **Everything that is
   not a plain character passes straight through the instant it arrives** — an
   arrow, `Delete`, `Esc`, any `Ctrl`/`Alt` chord is never buffered, so it can
   never be swallowed. (Earlier attempts carried a marker/`Esc`/VT-sequence
   state machine that matched none of these inputs yet sat between every one of
   them and the agent; each rev fixed one input and broke another until it was
   removed.)
2. **A run is a paste only if it carries an interior newline.** Delivering
   newlines to the agent one keystroke at a time is the sole thing this path
   exists to prevent — it is what submits a prompt mid-paste — so it is the only
   thing acted on. A newline-free run is emitted as the keys it was, because the
   clock times when a key is *read*, not when it was pressed: under load two
   keys a person typed 100 ms apart can be read together, and coalescing on
   length alone announced a phantom "pasted 2 characters" mid-type. A run that
   merely *ends* at a newline is a typed line submitted with `Enter`, so it too
   stays keys and still submits.

The result is that a multi-line paste reaches the agent as one bracketed paste
— which it renders as a paste (Claude Code collapses it to `[Pasted text #1 +N
lines]`) rather than as typing — while every editing key and every keystroke of
ordinary typing is untouched. The loop waits at most 10 ms for the next key
while a run is open and not at all otherwise, so an idle interface polls exactly
as before. The coalescer is inert where `Event::Paste` arrives on its own, and
its decisions are unit-tested on every platform against a driven clock.

This is the *inbound* half of a journey whose outbound half is ADR-13's
`PsmuxPaste` (`backend::psmux`): the reassembled paste is carried to a psmux pane in one piece by
psmux's own paste command.

## ADR-5: Responsive layout breakpoints

> **Superseded by ADR-23.** Breakpoints are no longer compiled in: `ui/layout.lua`
> decides the arrangement and can branch on width however it likes, and the kernel
> resolves rects before calling any plugin. The tiers below are what the shipped
> `layout.lua` still does by default, so they remain the behaviour a user sees.

**Choice**: Three layout tiers based on terminal width:

- `<80 cols` — terminal panel only (full screen)
- `>=80 cols` — two panels (left panel + terminal)
- `>=120 cols` — three panels (left panel + terminal + info)

The left panel is a single session list.

**Why**: 80 columns is the smallest usable terminal width. Below
that, showing a sidebar wastes too much space. At 120+, there's
room for supplementary info without shrinking the terminal panel
below readable width. Fixed breakpoints are predictable — the
layout never "jitters" near a threshold.

**Rejected**:

- *Fixed layout (always 3 panels)* — unusable on small terminals.
- *User-configurable breakpoints* — premature complexity.
  Can be added later if needed.

---

## ADR-6: File-based logging only

**Choice**: All tracing output goes to
`~/.local/share/talos/talos.log`.
Nothing writes to stdout or stderr.

**Why**: The TUI owns stdout entirely. Any stray `println!` or
log line to stdout would corrupt the terminal display. File-based
logging also makes it easy to `tail -f` the log in a second
terminal while developing.

**Rejected**:

- *Stderr logging* — crossterm's alternate screen captures stderr
  on some platforms, still risks display corruption.
- *In-app log panel* — useful eventually, but adds complexity
  before the core features are stable.

---

## ADR-7: Build profiles

| Profile | `opt-level` | LTO | Strip | Debug | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dev` | 0 | off | no | yes | Fast iteration |
| `test` | 1 | off | no | yes | Faster tests, still debuggable |
| `release` | 3 | full | yes | no | Distribution binary |
| `release-with-debug` | 3 | full | no | yes | Profiling / flamegraph |

**Why**: `test` at opt-level 1 catches optimization-dependent bugs
earlier while keeping compile times reasonable. The release profile
strips everything for a minimal binary. `release-with-debug` exists
specifically for `perf` / `flamegraph` workflows.

---

## ADR-8: State storage — SQLite

**Choice**: All persistent state (sessions, worktrees,
automations) is stored in a single SQLite
database at `~/.local/share/talos/talos.db` (respects
`$XDG_DATA_HOME`). WAL mode enables concurrent multi-instance
access. Agent definitions are the one exception: they live in a
human-editable TOML file (see ADR-19), not the database.

*This supersedes the original TOML file-based approach
(`~/.config/talos/config.toml`), which was eliminated after
the SQLite migration.*

**Why**: SQLite provides atomic transactions, concurrent access
via WAL mode, and a single source of truth. Multi-instance sync
uses `PRAGMA data_version` polling (see ADR-7b). The TUI provides
all editing UI — there is no need for a human-editable config file.

Every connection sets a **5 s busy_timeout** (the DB is shared by
the TUI, `talos-cli`, and the automation heartbeat; writes are
short single-row upserts, so a bounded wait beats an immediate
`SQLITE_BUSY` error or an unbounded freeze) plus the WAL-friendly
performance pragmas `synchronous = NORMAL`, `cache_size`, `mmap_size`,
and `temp_store = MEMORY` (`storage::schema::initialize`; rationale in
`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` ADR-P6). The append-only
**audit log is pruned to 90 days** on `Database::open` — entries
are debugging breadcrumbs, not compliance data, and unbounded
growth would bloat the database over months of use.

**Rejected**:

- *TOML config file (previous)* — race conditions when multiple
  instances write concurrently; split source of truth between
  config.toml and state files (sessions); no atomic multi-key
  updates. (Agent definitions are read-mostly and not subject to
  concurrent writes, so they remain in TOML — see ADR-19.)
- *JSON* — verbose for config, no atomic writes without
  temp-file-rename pattern.
- *CLI flags only* — doesn't scale to multiple sessions and
  long-lived configuration.
- *Embedded in AGENTS.md* — mixes repo-specific AI guidance with
  application configuration; wrong separation of concerns.

---

## ADR-8b: Automations fire with or without the TUI

**Choice**: Automations fire from three places that all funnel
through one headless entry point, `talos-cli automation tick`:
the TUI tick loop, a **heartbeat** this machine's backend keeps
running (`SessionBackend::ensure_heartbeat`, armed on TUI startup and
on `automation create`, looping `tick` every 60 s — on a tmux-protocol
server, the detached `automation-heartbeat` window; ADR-32), and
optional systemd/launchd
units (`packaging/`) for reboot-proof firing. Concurrency is made
safe by **claim-based firing** — `Database::claim_due_automation`
advances `next_run_at` with an atomic compare-and-swap, so exactly
one firer wins per due automation.

**Why**: The previous one-shot "scheduled command" fired even with
the TUI shut down by riding tmux's `run-shell` timers; the new
model must keep that durability for recurring + spawn automations.
A live keeper window both runs the heartbeat and keeps the tmux
server alive (a bare pending `run-shell` job does not), so even
spawn-only automations fire with no other sessions. Claim-first
ordering gives at-most-once semantics (a crash loses a run rather
than double-firing), the right default for agent prompts. tmux is
local-only; the send/spawn dispatch sits behind a seam so a future
remote/SSH `SessionBackend` (ADR-2) slots in without changing the
scheduler.

**Rejected**:

- *Per-automation `run-shell` timers (old style)* — precise to the
  second but require bookkeeping + re-arming N timers on startup; a
  single polling keeper is simpler and naturally handles
  create/edit/delete.
- *A bespoke long-running daemon* — duplicates what tmux (already
  required) and systemd/launchd provide; more moving parts.

---

## ADR-9: Flat session list (no project grouping)

> **Amended.** The decision below is about the *data model* and still
> holds: there is no project entity, and storage migration v16 dropped
> its tables. The list now renders selectable host and repo fold rows, with
> forked sessions nested within each repo group. These are view rows derived
> from host config and each session's `cwd`/`parent_session_id`; they add no
> project entity or creation step to the data model.
> The list itself is now `ui/plugins/10_sessions.lua`, not Rust (ADR-23).

**Choice**: The sidebar is a single flat list of sessions. There
is no "project" layer above sessions: each session picks its own
agent and repo selection at creation time.

**Why**: Earlier versions grouped sessions under projects (one
project → many sessions, with shared repos). In practice users
created one session per task, so the project layer was pure
overhead — an extra navigation level, an extra creation step, and
an extra deletion guard. Storage migration v16 dropped the
`projects`, `project_repos`, `project_vm_config`, and
`project_container_config` tables and removed `project_id` columns
from `sessions`, `vms`, and `containers`.

**Rejected**:

- *Two-section sidebar (projects on top, sessions on bottom)* —
  the previous design. Cost a navigation level and a creation
  step for no gain in the typical one-session-per-task workflow.
- *Modal/popup project selector* — hides context while working,
  forces re-opening to switch.
- *Tabs for projects* — horizontal tabs consume vertical space
  and don't scale well past 4-5 entries.

---

## ADR-11: Trait-based session backends

**Choice**: Session lifecycle is abstracted behind a
`SessionBackend` trait (`src/backend/contract.rs`). The `Session`
struct wraps the trait and manages reader/writer loops once,
regardless of which backend is active.

**Why**: Every consumer — `session_ops`, `cli` and `kernel` — reaches a
session through the trait and the registry that holds one backend per route
(ADR-29), never through an adapter, which `tests/architecture_rules.rs`
enforces (`consumers_reach_no_concrete_backend`). The adapters today are
`TmuxBackend`, `PsmuxBackend`, and `RmuxBackend`, peers over the shared tmux-protocol server
(ADR-31), each reached locally or on a host over a `TmuxTransport` (ADR-13).
A multiplexer that does not speak the tmux protocol is a new adapter behind the
same trait, not a branch in a consumer.
The tmux-compatible connection takes its optional flow-control setup command
from each adapter's `ControlPolicy`; a backend without that facility leaves it
absent. The shared lifecycle asks for outcomes through `SessionBackend` and
does not send control-mode commands.

**Trait methods**, by job (the list itself is `src/backend/contract.rs`):

- *the attach/render half*: `check_available`, `ensure_ready`, `spawn`,
  `adopt`, `discover`, `resize`, `claim_size`, `is_dead`, `kill`, `detach`,
  plus snapshots and state seeding (title and mouse modes);
- *the headless lifecycle* (ADR-29): `create_window`, `locate`,
  `rename_windows`, `stamp_window`, `window_panes`, `set_pane_retention`;
- *pane I/O by pane id* (ADR-30): `send_text`, `send_key`, `capture`,
  `pane_state`, `pane_path`, `pane_pid(s)`, `pane_ids`;
- *hook status and the heartbeat* (ADR-32): `hook_signal_command`,
  `record_hook_state`, `hook_states`, `take_hook_state_events`,
  `ensure_heartbeat`, `heartbeat_running`, `stop_heartbeat`.

A `backend_id` crossing the trait is the multiplexer's **pane id** (for example,
tmux's `%N`), not a backend's name: the column predates the contract and keeps
its name as public JSON. The backend a row belongs to is its route,
`backend_type` (ADR-28).

**Vocabulary.** Each word names one thing, and a name built from it says which:

| Word | Means | Type |
|---|---|---|
| backend | whatever implements the contract for one route | `dyn SessionBackend` |
| adapter | a concrete backend for one multiplexer | `TmuxBackend`, `PsmuxBackend` |
| multiplexer (mux) | the program that keeps panes alive | `session::Multiplexer` |
| platform | the OS of the machine a multiplexer runs on | `session::Platform` |
| host | a machine other than this one, as configured | `session::HostDef` |
| launcher | how a command reaches a host: ssh, WSL, or nothing | `shell::HostLauncher` |
| transport | a launcher plus the multiplexer binary run through it | `TmuxTransport` |
| route | a machine plus a multiplexer; the registry's key | `session::Route` |
| pane id | the multiplexer's handle for one pane (tmux: `%N`) | `backend_id` |

"tmux" in a name means the tmux protocol (`tmux_compat`, `TmuxTransport`,
`TmuxCompatible`) or the tmux adapter, never "any multiplexer". The persisted
and published spellings — `backend_type`, `backend_id`, `tmux_socket` — predate
the vocabulary and keep their names, because changing them would break every
reader of the database and the JSON (`docs/CONFIG.md` → Relocating an
instance).

**Key design decisions**:

- `spawn()` returns `(backend_id, output_reader, input_writer)`.
  The `Session` struct owns the reader/writer loops.
- `adopt()` reconnects to an existing session and returns initial
  screen content for parser seeding.
- `discover()` lists existing sessions for restore-on-startup.
- `detach()` stops streaming without killing the session.
- `kill()` permanently destroys the session.

**Rejected**:

- *Async trait methods* — added complexity for no benefit since
  the tmux backend uses synchronous `Command::new("tmux")`.
  Can be added via `async-trait` if a future backend needs it.

---

## ADR-12: Local tmux as default backend

**Choice**: The default `SessionBackend` is the platform's multiplexer
(`Multiplexer::platform_default`) over the local transport
(`TmuxTransport::local()`): `TmuxBackend` under `local:tmux`, or
`PsmuxBackend` under `local:psmux` on native Windows (ADR-31). Either runs a
dedicated server
(`tmux -L talos`) with session name `talos`. All I/O goes
through tmux control mode (`-C`). (The transport abstraction that
also enables remote SSH backends is ADR-13; here the choice is
simply that the out-of-the-box backend runs tmux locally.)

**Why**: tmux provides session persistence (survives crashes),
multi-instance support (multiple talos processes can independently
interact with the same sessions), and external recovery
(`tmux -L talos attach`). It handles terminal capability queries
(DA1/DA2) natively via `extended-keys on`, eliminating the need for
talos to intercept and respond to these sequences.

Control mode (`-C`) supports multiple concurrent client connections,
each receiving independent output streams. Each talos instance
establishes its own control mode connection, allowing all instances
to simultaneously monitor and interact with the same tmux sessions.
Output arrives as `%output` notifications, input is sent via
`send-keys -H` (hex-encoded). This eliminates the previous
`pipe-pane` + FIFO approach which suffered from tmux data-loss
bugs (#641, #2989), required 3 external deps in the data path
(`mkfifo`, `stdbuf`, `cat`), and had no flow control.

Only bytes below `0x20` and `\` are octal-escaped in `%output`; the rest
arrive raw, and tmux cuts a pane's output into lines wherever its read
ended, often inside a multi-byte character. So the reader takes a
`%output` payload as bytes and never decodes the line as text first:
decoded one line at a time, each half of a split character becomes
U+FFFD, which vt100 drops, and a non-ASCII word loses a letter
(`tests/lazy_terminals.rs`).

**Configuration on init**:

- `status off` — no tmux status bar (talos renders its own)
- `default-terminal xterm-256color` — standard terminal type
- `history-limit 5000` — reasonable scrollback
- `mouse on` — on tmux, lets programs inside panes detect mouse support and
  request wheel reports. Talos forwards those reports through control mode;
  programs that leave capture off still use normal-screen scrollback
- `extended-keys on` — enhanced key reporting
- `extended-keys-format csi-u` — the modern, unambiguous format some agents
  (e.g. `pi`) probe for at startup; talos injects keys via `send-keys` so this
  only sets the reported format, not the bytes agents receive. Best-effort: the
  option is tmux 3.5+ while talos's floor is 3.2, so a 3.2–3.4 host silently
  skips it
- `window-size manual` — each window sizes independently of the smallest
  attached client. Said **per window, as it is born** (`birth_options`), never
  server-wide: tmux asks a window's size before the window exists, and a
  server-wide `manual` dereferences a NULL window there and takes the server
  down (measured, tmux 3.5a). Which of several attached talos instances
  sizes a window is ADR-27
- `pause-after 5` — flow control (auto-resumed by reader)

`remain-on-exit` is **not** set here: it is a window option whose right value
depends on what the window is for, so each window states its own at spawn
(`keeps_dead_pane`). An agent's window keeps its dead pane — its liveness is
read from a listing (`#{pane_dead}`), and the corpse holds the error it printed.
A companion shell's and a plugin's program's do not: those are read from their
pane's output stream, and tmux announces a pane's death only by closing its
window, so a kept window is an ending that is never announced.

`off` is also in `WINDOW_OPTS`, which is not a duplicate of the per-window
setting but the *birth* value: the user's `~/.tmux.conf` is read on talos's
socket too, and a global `remain-on-exit on` there would have every window born
keeping its corpse — including a program that dies in the round trip between
`new-window` and its own option being set. The one role that wants a corpse
asks for it; nothing inherits one. A window found again on restart is
normalised where it is looked up by name (`find_program_window`), which is one
round trip and knows the answer from the name it searched for — the generic
adopt path stays free of it, since that path also carries every agent pane on
every ssh host.

**Window naming**: `tb-<session-name>` prefix for discovery. The prefix is not
identity — names are not unique, and a soft-deleted row keeps its name and its
remembered pane id until the reaper lets it go. Every caller that acts on a
session's window, live lookup or teardown alike, resolves it through the stamp
`WindowIndex` reads off the window itself rather than the name or the
remembered pane id; see ADR-25.

**Which socket**: `talos` (`talos-dev` for a dev build) for an instance
running out of the default data dir, and `talos-<digest of that dir>` for one
`TALOS_DATA_DIR` has relocated (`backend::instance::socket_for`). The data dir is
the anchor because it holds the database, and the database is the record of
which sessions exist: an instance keeping its own record of them has no
business creating their windows on the operator's server — which is what made
a real-binary `session create` unsafe for an integrator to test, and left the
`automation-heartbeat` window (not a session, so no `session delete` reclaims
it) behind on it. A relocated *config* dir alone changes nothing: it shares the
default instance's database, and so its sessions. `TALOS_SOCKET` overrides
both, and is what talos injects into each session it spawns so an in-session
`talos-cli` is *told* the socket rather than re-deriving it from a tmux
server's inherited environment. `version --json` reports the name in force —
never assume it. Relocation is not a migration: an instance moved before this
existed keeps its old sessions on the old server (docs/CONFIG.md → Relocating
an instance).

**Output streaming**: `%output` notifications from control mode,
demultiplexed by pane ID into per-pane broadcast channels. Multiple
instances can simultaneously register the same pane; output is
broadcast to all registered channels via `HashMap<String, Vec<SyncSender>>`.
Each channel feeds a `ControlModeReader` (implements `Read`) consumed
by the existing `Session::reader_loop`. This allows multiple instances
to independently parse and render terminal state in real-time.

**Input**: `send-keys -H <hex>` through the shared control mode
stdin, wrapped in a `ControlModeWriter` (implements `Write`), which encodes
the bytes the way its adapter's `PaneInput` says. The **psmux** adapter, whose
multiplexer has no `-H`, encodes the byte stream from the primitives psmux does
support, and sends a **paste** out of control mode entirely through psmux's own
`send-paste` — see "psmux divergences from tmux" under ADR-13 below, and
`backend::psmux`'s `PsmuxPaste`.

**Command synchronization**: All commands that precede a
`send_command` (waited) call must themselves be waited. A
fire-and-forget (`send_command_nowait`) leaves an unclaimed
`%begin`/`%end` response in the stream that can steal the next
waiter. `send_command_nowait` is only safe when nothing follows
(e.g., `detach`) or when issued from the reader thread itself
(e.g., pause resume).

A command list (`a ; b ; c`, sent by `ControlMode::send_command_list`) answers
with one `%begin`/`%end` block per command it runs — each gets its own command
number, so nothing on the wire marks the blocks as belonging together (measured,
tmux 3.2 and 3.7c) — and an error drops the rest of the list. The waiter that
sent the list therefore records how many blocks it holds and keeps its queue
slot until that many have arrived or the first `%error` does, concatenating
their lines into one answer (issue #1120). The tmux adapter's headless
`create_window` relies on
this to fold `new-window` and its window options into one list without a later
command being answered by one of the list's own blocks.

**Session restore**: On reconnect (`tmux_compat::Server::adopt`),
`capture-pane -e -p -J -S -<scrollback_lines>` seeds the fresh
vt100 parser with the pane's scrollback history **and** visible
screen (text + colors; `-J` rejoins wrapped lines so they re-wrap
at the new width). Without this seed the parser starts empty and
a session's pre-restart history cannot be scrolled in the UI —
the `%output` stream only carries bytes emitted after connect. A
forced resize then triggers SIGWINCH, causing the TUI application
to repaint its visible screen through the normal `%output` stream
— this delivers pixel-perfect rendering of the live region on top
of the seeded history. Seeding is best-effort: a failed capture
logs a warning and adoption proceeds with an empty seed.

The seed also carries the pane's **window title**, replayed ahead
of the history as an OSC 2 (`title_seed_bytes`). Agents use the
title as their activity line — Claude Code writes the task it is
on, and the session list renders it beside the name — and talos
reads it off the PTY, so an adopt that joins the stream mid-flight
showed nothing there until the agent next repainted it. tmux kept
the value (`#{pane_title}` *is* the last OSC the pane emitted), so
adopt reads it back and replays it through the same callback a
live title takes; nothing downstream learns a second way of being
told. A pane that never had one reads back as `#{host_short}` —
tmux's default, not an agent's line — and is suppressed. The query
is its own best-effort round trip rather than a chain onto the
capture: a mux that answers it differently (psmux is unverified
here) must lose the activity line, never the scrollback. The
attention notification (OSC 9/777) is deliberately **not**
restored — it is an event, not state.

The same query reads the pane's **mouse modes**
(`#{mouse_standard_flag}`, `#{mouse_button_flag}`, `#{mouse_all_flag}`,
`#{mouse_any_flag}`, `#{mouse_sgr_flag}`, `#{mouse_utf8_flag}`) and
replays them as DECSETs ahead of the title (`mouse_seed_bytes`).
Whether a wheel tick is forwarded to the app is read off talos's own
parser, and an app turns tracking on once, at startup — a repaint
redraws its cells, not its modes. Without the replay, a Codex adopted
by a later interface could not be scrolled at all: its alternate screen
keeps no scrollback for talos to scroll locally instead. A flag a
server does not know expands to nothing and reads as off; when only
`mouse_any_flag` is on, `?1000` is replayed, which is all the wheel needs.

**Rejected**:

- *`pipe-pane` + FIFO (previous)* — intermittent data loss from
  tmux bugs #641/#2989, required `mkfifo`/`stdbuf`/`cat` in the
  data path, no flow control, timing race on initial capture.
- *Screen/dtach* — less widely available, fewer features.

## ADR-13: Off-local sessions via an SSH / WSL tmux transport

**Choice**: Run agent sessions on a remote host (over SSH) or in a
local WSL distro (via `wsl.exe`) by launching the same tmux
control-mode protocol behind a launch prefix. The local tmux backend is
generalized into `tmux_compat::server::Server<M> { transport, socket,
session, name, platform }` — one per tmux-compatible multiplexer `M`, tmux
and psmux each an adapter of their own (ADR-31) — where `transport:
TmuxTransport` is two independent halves: an optional **launcher**
(`shell::HostLauncher` — `Ssh { destination, ssh_opts }` for `ssh <dest> …`,
`Wsl { distro }` for `wsl.exe -d <distro> …`, none to run on this machine) and
the **multiplexer** binary run there (the adapter's own, whatever the host
prefers). The launcher is the same one every other remote command uses (`git`,
probes, usage reads), built by the one conversion `HostLauncher::for_host`, and
it carries any program's command line unchanged (`shell::launch`); it adds no
`-L` — that is the tmux grammar's flag, added by `TmuxTransport::tmux_command`. The
transport's *only* job is to build the `Command`; everything downstream
— the control-mode reader/writer threads, pane registration,
`send-keys`/`%output` — is the same whichever launcher carried it
(`control_mode` is transport-agnostic). What differs between tmux and psmux
is not the transport's business: it is the adapter's, behind
`TmuxCompatible` (ADR-31). SSH and WSL both join and
shell-interpret the trailing POSIX-quoted tokens identically; only the
launcher differs. `platform` is the OS of the machine the multiplexer
runs on — see "The host's platform is its own dimension" below.

Hosts are declared as data in `~/.config/talos/hosts.toml`
(`session::HostDef { kind: HostKind {Ssh, Wsl}, … }`/`HostRegistry`),
and WSL distros are additionally **auto-discovered**
(`agent::host_config::discover_wsl_hosts` via `wsl.exe -l -q`). The
combined set is loaded by `agent::host_config::load_all`, and each host
gets one backend per adapter, named by its route (`ssh:<host>:<mux>` /
`wsl:<distro>:<mux>`, `backend::wiring`).

**Why WSL = "SSH without the ssh"**: `wsl.exe` runs `tmux`, `git`, the
agent, and the worktrees all *inside* the distro at native Linux paths,
so there's no Windows↔Linux path translation (`wslpath`) and the
worktree layout matches the SSH path exactly. Modeling WSL as a host
kind (rather than a per-session "run in WSL" flag wrapping a native
psmux pane) reuses the entire remote-host subsystem — picker,
persistence/restore, `git::*_on`, headless `--host` — for free.

**Why** (general): The local-vs-off-local difference is exactly one
line (how the tmux process is launched). The per-session control
commands travel over the stdin pipe, not the launcher argv, so only the
one-time `attach-session` launch crosses the boundary. SSH relies on
the system `ssh` binary + `~/.ssh/config` for auth/keys/multiplexing;
WSL needs no credentials at all.

**Key design decisions**:

- **Lazy registration**: off-local backends are registered but *not*
  connected at startup (`check_available`/`ensure_ready` deferred to
  first use), so a down host (or slow WSL discovery) never blocks the
  TUI. Choosing a row's backend is only a registry lookup
  (`session_ops::windows::backend_for`, ADR-29); the blocking
  `ensure_ready` runs on the spawn worker, never on the UI thread (ADR-P12).
- **`wsl.exe` never shares the interface's terminal** (`shell::wsl_exe`):
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows, a session of its own (`setsid`) on Unix.
  A `wsl.exe` child takes its parent console's keyboard input even with
  stdin, stdout and stderr all redirected, and relays it into the distro.
  The control-mode connection is such a child for as long as a WSL
  session is attached, so on native Windows the interface went on
  painting while every key went to the distro instead. Measured on
  Windows 11: a console reader received 0 of 8 keys beside `wsl.exe -d
  <distro> sleep 40`, and 8 of 8 with the flag; with a session attached,
  release 2.41.7 never opened the palette while this build opened it in
  ~230 ms. Not applied to `ssh`, which was not measured.
- **Auto-discovery**: WSL distros appear with zero config; an explicit
  `kind = "wsl"` entry of the same name wins (for overrides like
  `worktrees_dir`). `discover_wsl_hosts` decodes `wsl.exe`'s UTF-16LE
  output and is a no-op without `wsl.exe`. It runs inside a distro too
  (interop exports `wsl.exe`), so a talos in one distro reaches its
  siblings — but **never itself**: the distro named by `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`
  is a *loopback* (`HostDef::is_wsl_loopback`) and is dropped from both
  halves of the registry. Registering one made every local session
  remote, because a shareable host's own database is the record of its
  sessions (ADR-24) and that database was this one: the mirror pass read
  our own rows back and rewrote each `backend_type` to `wsl:<us>`, after
  which every attach, diff and delete went out through `wsl.exe` at the
  machine it started on.
- **A spelling another host claims is unreadable, and is left alone.**
  The clearest case is a configured host that merely *registers* under
  `wsl:<us>` while pointing elsewhere
  (`HostDef::shadows_current_wsl_distro`): it is left **exactly as
  written** — it works, and renaming or dropping it would strand or
  misroute its sessions. What it costs is the one-time repair, for that
  one name: the rows under it are two populations at once, local rows
  the bug relabelled before the entry existed and the host's own sibling
  rows written after, and nothing in the database tells them apart.
  Relabelling them all local sends the sibling's sessions at this
  machine; moving them all onto the sibling sends this machine's at the
  sibling. So the repair skips the name entirely, and says so when it
  actually left rows behind — `rows_recorded_on` counts them, because a
  host that claims the spelling but never wrote a row has nothing to be
  told about, and this notice is the only one its owner would ever see.
  The same rule covers a *dropped loopback's own* backend name, which is
  a free label and can be a live sibling's: dropping the entry hands the
  name back to auto-discovery, so the real distro re-registers under
  exactly that spelling. The residue is the pre-existing corruption left
  unhealed, not damage the change does, and it is the only outcome that
  never operates on the wrong machine.
- **The one-time repair**: rows a released build already relabelled are
  put back by `session_ops::repair_wsl_loopback_rows`, not by the
  migration — schema v47 only marks it **owed**, and every startup that
  opens the database runs it (the TUI boot and the `talos-cli`
  entrypoint, since the mark is written by whichever binary opens the
  database first and a headless install need never launch the
  interface). `storage` may reference `session` but not `agent`, so the
  migration cannot decide what to rewrite: that is
  `agent::host_config::wsl_repair_plan`, which settles the registry and
  augments it with discovery in the same order the loader does, so what
  it rewrites and what a session resolves against cannot disagree about
  who owns a spelling. Candidates = `wsl:<us>` plus every dropped
  loopback's own backend name (a hand-written `name = "self"` wrote
  `wsl:self`); each one a served host registers under goes to
  `withheld` instead of `to_local`, matched on the whole backend name
  since that is what a row resolves through.
- **A withheld name is an answer, and the repair retires on it.** Those
  rows never become classifiable — the claiming host's own remote rows and
  the ones the bug mislabelled are the same spelling — so waiting for the
  claim to disappear would not settle them, it would rewrite them once
  the *evidence* was gone and relabel a live sibling's sessions local.
  The mark is therefore cleared, and dropping the entry afterwards leaves
  those rows exactly where they are, under a name no host registers.
  Only a question that could not be **asked** keeps the mark, and only
  when the answer depended on it: a `hosts.toml` that would not parse,
  distros that could not be enumerated, a failed write. Each is asked
  solely where it can matter — `$WSL_DISTRO_NAME` is read first, so off
  WSL nothing is owed whatever `hosts.toml` says (only a loopback wrote
  these rows, and only a talos inside a distro can have one), and
  enumeration is consulted only for a candidate discovery could
  decide, never for `wsl:<us>`, the one spelling it filters out. So the
  ordinary repair parses one file, spawns no subprocess, and retires.
  Silence must never read as "nothing claims it", while a machine with
  no `wsl.exe` at all is a definite "no distros" (interop puts `wsl.exe`
  on `PATH` inside a distro, so the two cases do not overlap). The bookmark half resolves colliding
  readings of one path on recency (`(host, repo_path)` is the key, so
  only one can survive) and the survivor inherits the group's
  `is_parent`/`parent_path`, so a healed parent keeps the mark its
  children hang off.
- **Selection**: host and multiplexer are independent. The TUI asks for a
  host and then a registered multiplexer; `session create --host` and
  `--multiplexer` are the headless equivalents. `BackendChoice` resolves
  explicit choice before configured host/local preference before the platform
  default, and its routing key is persisted.
- **Persistence/restore**: `backend_type` round-trips in SQLite;
  restore discovers windows **per backend** so off-local sessions
  re-adopt against their own host's tmux.
- **Off-local worktrees**: `git::*_on(host, …)` run git via
  `git::host_launcher` (`ssh …` or `wsl.exe …`). Worktree paths resolve
  under the host's `worktrees_dir` (or `$HOME/.local/share/talos/…`
  resolved + cached, keyed by backend name since a WSL host has no
  `destination`).

**Module placement**: `HostDef`/`HostRegistry`/`HostKind` live in
`session/` (the dependency sink) so both `agent` (builds the backend)
and `git` (runs git on the host) can depend on them without violating
the module-isolation rules.

**Riskiest area**: SSH reconnect on a flapping link — `reconnect_control`
reopens the ssh connection; ControlMaster + keepalives mitigate
stalls. Worth the most manual testing.

**Rejected**:

- *A `TmuxTransport` trait with `Box<dyn>`* — an optional
  `HostLauncher` plus a binary name is simpler; promote to a trait only if a
  launcher that is not a command prefix (e.g. a container API) appears. A
  second multiplexer does not count toward that: it is an adapter (ADR-31),
  and one that does not speak the tmux protocol is a `SessionBackend` of its
  own rather than a transport.
- *Embedded SSH library (russh, etc.)* — reimplements `~/.ssh/config`,
  agent forwarding, and multiplexing that the system `ssh` already
  provides.
- *Re-registering a `wsl:<us>` shadow under the distro it reaches, and
  moving its rows onto that name* — built and withdrawn, not merely
  considered. It cannot be made correct: the shadow's backend name *is*
  `wsl:$WSL_DISTRO_NAME`, so the rows under it are two populations at
  once — local rows an older release mislabelled before the entry
  existed, and the host's own remote rows written through it after — and
  nothing in the database separates them. Renaming them all onto the
  sibling misassigns the local ones; relabelling them all local
  misassigns the sibling's. Narrowing *which* host the rename targets
  does not help, because the ambiguity is in the rows, not the target.
  Leaving every such row alone is the only outcome that never operates
  on the wrong machine, so the entry stays exactly as written and the
  repair withholds that one spelling. Do not reintroduce the rename.

### psmux divergences from tmux

The control-mode protocol is byte-identical over either transport, but the
**psmux** binary diverges from tmux in the places below (verified against
psmux 3.3.6 unless a different version is named). Each is the psmux adapter's answer to `TmuxCompatible`
(`backend::psmux`), never a branch on the binary's name in shared code
(ADR-31). The `talos-remote-hosts` skill keeps a summary; this is the
reference to read before touching that path.

- **Cold server creation can outlast the psmux client.** On psmux 3.3.8,
  `new-session -d` sometimes returned `psmux: failed to create session`, or
  returned success before the server could answer its next command. Its
  `has-session` removes the session port file after a failed TCP connection,
  including one to a server that is still starting. The adapter instead probes
  with `list-windows`, which leaves that file intact. It omits `-x/-y` for the
  initial placeholder so psmux may claim a warm server, retries a transient
  `no server running` answer during setup or window creation, and gives a late
  server a bounded final wait. Psmux can route an untargeted `set-option -g` to
  the nonexistent `__default` session; server options therefore include
  `-t <session>`.
  tmux retains its size arguments and one attempt. The failure also occurs
  without Talos and is not a v2.42.0 control-mode regression.
- **`send-keys -H`** was absent in psmux 3.3.6 (it injected the hex digits as literal
  text). `psmux_send_keys_commands` encodes input from the
  primitives psmux does support (`send-keys -l` literal runs +
  `Enter`/`Tab`/`Escape`/`BSpace`/`C-<letter>` key-names). Arrow and navigation
  escape sequences use one named key command, so psmux can deliver them as a
  complete key and select CSI or SS3 for the pane's cursor mode; splitting an
  arrow into `Escape` plus literal text delivered a bare Escape. tmux (incl. a WSL
  distro's tmux) keeps the byte-exact `-H` path. Literal runs go out as
  `-l -N 1 "…"` (double-quoted, `\"`/`\\` escaped): `-N` makes psmux's
  send-coalescing decoder — which re-quotes with a POSIX `'\''` escape its own
  parser can't read back (`it's` → `it\s`) — bail to the direct handler, which
  reads double-quote framing correctly (`flush_psmux_literal`/`psmux_quote`).
  Quoting alone isn't enough: psmux classifies arguments *after* tokenizing, so
  it drops any starting with `-` as an unknown flag (a typed hyphen never
  arrived, issue #920) and rewrites a `0xNN`-shaped argument into the character
  it names. `psmux_literal_args` re-emits such a leading character *as* a
  `0xNN` argument — psmux decodes it back and, in literal mode, joins arguments
  with no separator, reassembling the run exactly. Probed by
  `scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh test` (probe D).
- **`new-window` trailing tokens are not joined** (psmux keeps only the first
  and drops the rest — the agent launched with **no args**) and **`new-window
  -e` is ignored** (on the argv path too — no `TALOS_SESSION` identity).
  `psmux::psmux_window_powershell` folds env + command into **one token**
  of PowerShell (`Set-Item Env:K 'v'; & 'claude' '--session-id' …` — psmux runs
  it via `powershell -NoLogo -Command`, whose Win32 command line strips
  unescaped double quotes, hence PowerShell single-quoting throughout;
  backslash is literal in psmux's parser, so `C:\` paths survive). Control-mode
  spawns (`psmux_window_command`) frame it in double quotes (psmux's tokenizer
  concatenates adjacent `'…'` segments but passes `'` through `"…"` tokens); the
  headless local `create_window` passes it as a single argv arg. The local socket
  honors the `TALOS_SOCKET` env override (`local_socket()`, ahead of the
  data-dir derivation in ADR-12) so test/sandbox tooling can scope an instance
  on Windows, where every `-L <name>` resolves machine-wide (no `TMUX_TMPDIR`).
- **A paste cannot be key-encoded at all** (the encoding above emits ESC as its
  own `Escape` key-name, so the agent saw a bare Escape instead of the
  `ESC[200~` marker and took each embedded CR as Enter — a pasted stack trace
  submitted line by line). It goes **out of band** through psmux's own paste
  command (`psmux::PsmuxPaste`, issue #916): psmux's control-mode
  dispatcher implements no paste command (`paste-buffer`/`set-buffer`/
  `send-paste` are CLI/server-only), so a bracketed-paste payload
  (`bracketed_paste_text` unwraps one) goes to the one-shot CLI
  `psmux send-paste -t <pane> <base64>` — the same command psmux's client uses
  for Ctrl+Shift+V, so CRLF is normalized for ConPTY, markers are written
  contiguously and **only** when the pane's app enabled bracketed paste. A
  failure **drops** the paste with a warning, and so does a payload that is not
  one clean frame: falling back to the key encoding typed every CR as Enter,
  which ran each pasted line. Base64 because a raw newline in a psmux command
  argument is cut by the server's line-oriented read, truncating the payload *and*
  executing its tail as a command (psmux #560) — the same reason the headless
  prompt path (`TmuxCompatible::paste_args`, feeding `send_text`, and
  `deferred_paste_script`) sends `send-paste` where tmux gets
  `send-keys -l <ESC[200~…>`. Probed by `windows-vm.sh test` (probe C).
- **There are no per-window options.** `set-option -w -t <pane> @k v` stores one
  option for the whole server, and `#{@k}` then expands to *that* on every
  window — measured on a Windows host running psmux 3.3.6:

  ```console
  $ psmux -L probe set-option -w -t %3 @probe VALUE_FOR_W2
  $ psmux -L probe list-windows -F '#{pane_id}|#{window_name}|#{@probe}'
  %1|w1|VALUE_FOR_W2      # never set on this window
  %3|w2|VALUE_FOR_W2
  ```

  So the ADR-25 stamp cannot be written there (`stamp_window` and the local
  `create_window` write none) **and** cannot be read there
  (`stamps_are_per_window` gates `parse_discovered`, which drops both fields).
  Both halves are needed: writing alone poisoned the server — one session's id
  came back as every window's identity, so the session it named saw several
  windows claiming it (`Located::Unknown`) and every other session saw its own
  window stamped for somebody else (`Located::Absent`). Both read as
  "session has no pane yet", and since `Absent` is the one answer a relaunch
  acts on, each start gave those sessions a *second* agent window (issue #1168).
  Dropping the stamp on the read side is also what heals a server already
  carrying a global one, which no migration could reach: the option outlives
  every session it was written for and only `kill-server` clears it.
  psmux resolves by window name instead, which is what ADR-25 always intended
  for it.
- **The `attach-session` carried on argv is answered with nothing.** tmux
  replies to it with one `%begin`/`%end` block that is not a reply to anything
  the client sent, and `ControlMode::start` consumes it synchronously, before
  the reader thread exists, so no waiter can race it. psmux sends no such
  block — its command counter numbers the *client's* first command 1:

  ```console
  $ printf 'display-message -p first\ndisplay-message -p second\n' \
      | psmux -L probe -C attach-session -t talos
  %begin 1789657328 1 1     # the first command sent, not the attach
  %begin 1789657328 2 1
  ```

  So the drain is asked only of a multiplexer that answers
  (`ControlPolicy::implicit_attach_reply`, psmux's `false`). Asking psmux parks `ControlMode::start`
  on a `read_until` that returns only when psmux closes the pipe: `ensure_ready`
  never returns, `kernel::terminal`'s discovery worker never reports, and every
  session renders "session has no pane yet" with **nothing logged**, because
  nothing failed — it never came back. That was the headline symptom of issue
  #1168, and the stamp fix above does not reach it: the two are independent and
  either one alone leaves the interface attaching no pane at all.

### psmux 3.3.7 is the floor, asked of the server at each spawn

Before psmux 3.3.7 (psmux#450) the server's console attach/detach — which every
`send-keys C-c`, bracketed paste and mouse or VT injection performs, so ordinary
use of an agent pane — leaves the server's std handle slots on freed, recycled
handle values, and every pane born afterwards inherits them. The pane still has
its ConPTY, but its shell and the agent that shell launches read and write
whatever those values now name: nothing they print reaches the pane, and Claude
Code reports `stdin is unreadable (EISDIR)` (or `ENOTCONN` — the errno is
whatever the value was recycled into, a directory handle being the common one),
drops into `--print` and exits within two seconds. Measured on a Windows 11
host: with a burst of `send-keys C-c` at one window, 3.3.6 bore every later
window that way and 3.3.8 none. It looks path-dependent (it was first reported
on the existing-worktree flow) only because a long-lived server that has been
typed into is the precondition, not anything about the session.

The window command cannot work around it — the handles are corrupt from the
pane's birth, before any PowerShell of ours runs — so `spawn` and the headless
`create_window` refuse to create a pane on psmux older than 3.3.7 (the psmux
adapter's `VERSION_FLOOR`, `check_psmux_version`). They ask the **server** (`#{version}`), not the binary:
upgrading psmux leaves a server started before it on the old code, and the
message says to restart it. Only where no session exists yet, so no server to
ask, does the binary's `-V` answer — before it starts one that every spawn
would then refuse. Attaching to existing panes is not gated, so an
old server's sessions stay reachable until then.

### The host's platform is its own dimension

A session's place (this machine, an ssh host, a WSL distro), the host's OS, the
launcher that reaches it and the multiplexer that serves it are four
independent choices. The route (ADR-28) carries only place and multiplexer;
the OS is the host's, `HostDef::platform` (`session::Platform`: `Posix` or
`Windows`), and this machine's is `Platform::local` — the one place the build
OS is read as a platform.

- **Explicit, with the old reading as the default.** `hosts.toml`'s
  `platform = "posix" | "windows"` declares it. An entry that names none reads
  the way it always did: `multiplexer = "psmux"` was the declaration that a
  host is Windows before a platform could be written down, so it still is, and
  anything else is POSIX. A WSL distro is POSIX whatever its entry says.
  An adapter is built with the host's platform beside the host as configured
  (`BackendSpec`, ADR-31), so a legacy Windows entry driven for a `:tmux` row
  stays Windows. The headless status poll asks that same backend (ADR-32), so
  it is told nothing of its own.
- **Each decision reads the dimension it is about.** The shell a pane gets
  (`default_shell`), whether the server's `default-command` is pinned to a
  POSIX shell (`config_shell`), and the `/bin/sh -lc` login wrap all follow
  the platform of the machine the server runs on — never the OS talos was
  built for (a Windows talos driving a WSL distro used to leave that tmux on
  the login shell, because the pin sat behind `cfg(not(windows))`) and never
  the multiplexer's name (a Windows host on another multiplexer used to get
  `/bin/sh`). Whether the loop polls a backend for dead panes
  (`needs_liveness_poll`) is what its multiplexer can report: tmux announces
  `%window-close`, psmux does not, and any other multiplexer is polled until
  an adapter says otherwise. The contract's `default_shell` has no default, so
  no backend inherits this build's shell.
- **Nothing is reserved to an OS.** Every multiplexer name — including RMUX
  and the prospective Herdr — can be the route of a session on either
  platform, locally or on a host; whether one is usable is the registry's
  answer (`wiring::implements`), which does not depend on the OS: the tmux,
  psmux, and RMUX adapters are registered on every machine and every host
  (ADR-31). No Herdr adapter exists yet.
- **Enforced**: `tests/architecture_rules.rs`
  (`the_route_and_the_contract_know_no_launcher_adapter_or_build_os`) keeps
  `session::route` and `backend::contract` free of the launchers, host
  entries, the tmux adapter and its grammar, and of any `cfg(windows)`.
- **What is simulated.** The Windows-build branches are covered on Linux by
  `Platform::local`'s test override (`platform::simulate_local`). No
  multiplexer decision is behind `cfg(windows)` any more — the local psmux
  spawn path is the psmux adapter's on every OS (ADR-31) — and no test here ran
  against a live Windows host.

### A Windows host speaks PowerShell, not `sh`

psmux is the *multiplexer*; the divergence above is about its wire protocol.
Independent of it, a **native Windows** host (`HostDef::is_windows`, which reads
the platform above) has no POSIX shell at all. Every remote probe was `sh -c <script>`, which there
fails with PowerShell's `CommandNotFoundException` — so the repo picker could
not list a directory, classify a committed path, or import a folder of repos on
a Windows host.

- **One dispatch point, two dialects.** `git::host_probe(host, posix,
  windows)` picks `host_shell_c` or `host_powershell_c`, and each pair of
  scripts emits the **same line protocol** (`!missing`, `g <name>`/`d <name>`,
  `git`/`dir`/`missing`, one name per line) so every parser stays
  transport-neutral. A probe cannot become POSIX-only by omission.
- **`-EncodedCommand`, not `-Command`.** The script crosses two shells that both
  rewrite it: ssh space-joins its trailing args, and the host's default sshd
  shell — commonly PowerShell itself — expands `$…` inside double quotes. A
  probe reading `$PSVersionTable` came back with the *outer* shell's expansion
  (`System.Collections.Hashtable`) substituted in. UTF-16LE base64 is
  `[A-Za-z0-9+/=]`, so neither `cmd` nor PowerShell finds anything to
  interpret. Paths inside the script are PowerShell single-quoted
  (`powershell_quote`: only `'` is special, so `\` and `$` in a Windows path
  are literal).
- **There is no `$HOME`.** `echo $HOME` under `cmd`/PowerShell prints the string
  `$HOME` and exits 0, so the bogus value was accepted and every `~`-relative
  path became a literal `$HOME/…`. `git::remote_home` routes a Windows host to
  `%USERPROFILE%`; that choice lives there and nowhere else, because the one
  other copy of it (`spawn::resolve_launch_home`) was the only caller getting it
  right.

### A remote error has to name the failure

Two layers of transport noise sat in front of every error message a command
reported, both removed by `git::reportable_stderr` — which every helper in the
module reports through, local git included, because a `clone`/`fetch` runs over
ssh via `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` and carries the same advisory:

- **OpenSSH's post-quantum advisory.** OpenSSH ≥ 10 prints a three-line `**
  WARNING: connection is not using a post-quantum key exchange algorithm.` block
  on **stderr** for every connection to a server on an older OpenSSH — Windows
  hosts very much included. It is informational and the command still runs, but
  it is *first* in the buffer, so reporting stderr verbatim made every remote
  failure read as a key-exchange problem and pushed the real cause below the
  fold. Suppressing it at the source is not an option: `LogLevel=ERROR` would
  equally hide `Permission denied`, and `WarnWeakCrypto=no` is fatal on the
  older clients that never warn anyway — so the `**` lines are filtered from the
  *reported* text. When they are all there was, the exit status is reported
  instead (`describe_exit`), never the advisory again.
- **PowerShell's CLIXML stderr.** `powershell.exe` does not write error records
  as text when its stderr is redirected (which it always is here) — it writes a
  `#< CLIXML` document whose messages sit in `<S S="Error">` nodes with CRLF
  encoded as `_x000D__x000A_`, so a Windows failure arrived as `#< CLIXML <Objs
  Version=…`. `decode_clixml` strips the envelope whole and inlines the error
  text; a document carrying only a `progress` record (PowerShell's "Preparing
  modules for first use") decodes to nothing, so the exit status is reported
  rather than the markup. Raw text interleaved with an envelope — what
  `[Console]::Error.WriteLine` and any native command produce — is kept.

## ADR-7b: Multi-Instance Sync — SQLite with PRAGMA data_version

**Choice**: Multiple talos instances synchronize all state
(sessions, worktrees, automations)
via a shared SQLite database
(`~/.local/share/talos/talos.db`). Each instance polls
`PRAGMA data_version` to detect external changes. SQLite's WAL mode
handles concurrent access safely. Deletions use soft delete
(`deleted_at` column).

*This supersedes the original TOML file-based approach. The migration
to SQLite resolved race conditions where concurrent `save_state()` calls
could overwrite each other's writes.*

Session **I/O is NOT coordinated** via the database. Instead, each
instance independently connects to tmux and adopts all visible sessions.
Tmux natively handles concurrent clients: output is broadcast to all
connected clients, and input commands are serialized. This enables true
multi-instance collaboration without application-level locks or
ownership restrictions.

**Why**: This approach is:

- **Atomic**: SQLite transactions prevent torn writes and race conditions
- **Portable**: Works on Linux, macOS, any system with a filesystem
- **TEA-compatible**: External changes flow through the message pipeline
- **Graceful**: Single instance has zero polling overhead
- **Collaborative**: All instances can interact with the same sessions
  simultaneously (like tmux attach with multiple clients)
- **Single source of truth**: No split-brain between state files and DB

**Multi-Instance I/O Model**: Rather than using an ownership model
to prevent duplicate I/O, each instance maintains its own control mode
connection to tmux. Tmux's architecture already supports this:

- Each control mode client receives independent output streams
- Output is duplicated by tmux to all connected clients
- Input commands (`send-keys`) are serialized by tmux
- No application-level coordination needed

This design choice (post-ADR) was made to enable true collaboration while
avoiding the complexity of application-level locks or message-passing for
I/O coordination.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Not human-readable**: Unlike TOML, users cannot directly edit state.
  The TUI provides all editing UI (session creation, scheduling, theme
  selection). Agent definitions are the deliberate exception and remain
  hand-editable TOML (ADR-19).
- **Independent terminal state**: Each instance maintains its own
  `vt100::Parser`, so concurrent updates may briefly diverge. Instances
  converge quickly as output is replayed.
- **Concurrent input interleaving**: When multiple users type
  simultaneously, characters arrive in order at tmux but may display
  interleaved (same as `tmux attach` with multiple clients). This is
  **expected behavior** for multi-user terminal sessions.

**Rejected**:

- *Event-based sync (inotify/kqueue)* — platform-specific, requires
  different implementations for Linux/macOS/BSD, more complex error
  handling (file deletion, permission issues), adds monitoring
  overhead even for single-instance deployments.
- *gRPC/REST daemon* — requires deploying and managing a persistent
  service, adds operational complexity, increases failure surface area
  (daemon crashes, socket issues), incompatible with offline usage.
- *Git-based sync* — requires git repo for state, introduces gc/
  rebase issues, incompatible with non-repo environments.
- *TOML file-based sync (previous approach)* — race conditions when
  multiple instances write concurrently; no atomic multi-key updates;
  split source of truth between config.toml and state files
  (sessions) caused sync bugs.

---

## ADR-15: Headless CLI as Separate Binary

**Choice**: Headless automation lives in a separate binary
(`talos-cli`) that shares the same SQLite database as the TUI.
It exposes `session`, `automation`, `task`, `message`, `editor`,
`config`, `extension`, `version`, `update`, and `notify` management
as subcommands, printing JSON results.

**Why**: A separate binary keeps scripting/automation out of the
TUI's event loop. The TUI already polls `PRAGMA data_version`
on every tick (~10 ms event-loop cadence) (ADR-7b), so changes
made by `talos-cli` appear
automatically — no new synchronization mechanism is needed. The
`cli` module imports `storage`, `session`, `session_ops`, `sync`,
and `backend::tmux`, but never `app` or `ui`, so it can operate
without a terminal UI.

**Rejected**:

- *Embedded in the TUI binary* — would force the TUI to multiplex
  a non-interactive command path alongside its crossterm event
  loop.
- *A long-running daemon* — adds operational complexity; the
  shared SQLite DB plus tmux already provide the coordination a
  one-shot CLI needs.

---

## ADR-14: Centralized Theme Module

**Choice**: All UI colors are defined as associated constants on a
`Theme` struct in `kernel::theme` (v1 kept it in `src/ui/theme.rs`).
Plugins receive **roles** rather than colours
instead of using `Color::Cyan`, `Color::Gray`, etc. directly.

**Why**: ~50 hard-coded color values were scattered across 13+ widget
files. This made visual consistency difficult to maintain and made
any color scheme change require editing every file. Semantic names
(`ACCENT`, `STATUS_BUSY`, `TEXT_MUTED`) clarify intent at each call
site and enable future theming (dark/light/custom) with a single
module swap.

**Design**: `Theme` uses `const` associated items rather than a
global singleton or trait. This keeps it zero-cost (no runtime
dispatch, no initialization), works in const contexts, and is
trivially testable. Composite styles (e.g., `focused_title()`) are
`const fn` methods that combine colors with modifiers.

**Rejected**:

- *Global singleton / `lazy_static`* — runtime overhead, mutex
  contention in render path, unnecessary for static color values.
- *Trait-based theming* — over-engineering for the current need.
  Can be layered on top later if user-selectable themes are added.
- *CSS-like stylesheets* — no Rust TUI framework supports this
  natively; would require a custom parser and resolver.

---

## ADR-19: Declarative agent definitions

**Choice**: Each session runs exactly one coding-agent CLI chosen
at creation time; each agent runs with its own default config.
Agents are described as **data** in `~/.config/talos/agents.toml`
(sibling of any other config), seeded with built-ins (claude,
codex, antigravity, opencode, aider, copilot, vibe, pi, omp) on first run via
`agent::agent_config::load_or_seed`. An `AgentDef` carries a
`command`, `args` (always passed — bake in flags like a model
here if you want), and argument-template groups (`resume_args`,
`fork_args`, `new_session_args`), plus a `resume_latest` flag. A
single `agent::GenericProvider` (an `AgentProvider`) launches any
defined agent by substituting `{id}` and appending each group only
when its driving value is present. Claude and pi accept the
talos-generated id (`--session-id {id}`). Codex reports its own ID through
`SessionStart`, which talos stores separately for exact resume and fork.
The remaining resumable built-ins set `resume_latest = true` and use
id-less, cwd-scoped flags (`opencode --continue`, …) that make the agent resolve
"the last session in this directory" itself. `resume_latest` only governs *when* the resume
group fires at restart (`session_ops::resume_trigger_for`): for these
agents restart always resumes; claude still defers to an on-disk
transcript check.

**Why**: Talos started as Claude-Code-specific, with a hard-coded
`ClaudeProvider` plus roles, skills, profiles, and an MCP/plugin
surface tied to one agent's permission model. Generalizing to "run
any coding agent" meant the launch contract had to be data, not
code: users add or tweak agents by editing TOML, with no recompile
and no per-session permission/prompt/tool configuration. The
`session::AgentDef` / `AgentRegistry` types are pure data (no
filesystem, no local imports) so they satisfy the `session/`
isolation rule; the TOML loading and the provider bridge live in
`agent`.

**Group precedence**: fork wins over resume, which wins over a
fresh `new_session` id; static `args` follow. A group with no
value is simply omitted — no "unresolved placeholder" heuristics.

**Config, not DB**: Agent definitions deliberately live in TOML
rather than SQLite (ADR-8). They are read-mostly, hand-editable,
and shared across instances by re-reading the file — there is no
concurrent-write hazard that would justify moving them into the
database.

**Rejected**:

- *Hard-coded providers per agent* — the previous `ClaudeProvider`
  approach; adding an agent meant a code change and release.
- *Per-session roles / permissions / prompts / tools* — removed
  with the pivot. They were Claude-specific and did not generalize
  across agents; a session now configures only its agent.
- *Agent definitions in SQLite* — overkill for read-mostly,
  user-authored config; TOML keeps them inspectable and diffable.

## ADR-20: Agent-agnostic extensions in `extensions/`

**Choice**: Opt-in workflows that *compose* talos (rather than
extend the binary) live outside it as data + shell: a
plain-markdown behavior spec, portable scripts built on
`talos-cli` + `jq`, and an idempotent installer — the same
distribution model as `scripts/install.sh` and `packaging/`.
Extensions reach agents only through `agents.toml` **aliases**
that the user maps to any CLI, and surface their spec through
context-file symlinks (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` → the
spec), so no vendor is named anywhere.

**Why**: ADR-19's pivot made talos agent-neutral; an opinionated
LLM workflow (prompts, triage rubrics, tick cadences) would undo
that if baked into core, and it iterates on a much faster cadence
than the binary (editing a markdown spec vs. cutting a release).
Keeping extensions as data over the public surface (`talos-cli`
plus `agents.toml`) also makes that surface's stability a tested,
load-bearing contract.

**Rejected**:

- *Vendor plugin formats* (e.g. a Claude Code plugin) — couples
  the workflow to one agent's ecosystem; the same agent brain must
  be runnable by codex, antigravity, opencode, vibe, ….
- *A `talos-cli <workflow> init` subcommand with embedded assets*
  — puts one opinionated workflow inside the agent-neutral core and
  ties spec iteration to the release cycle.
- *A separate repository* — rejected at the time, on the grounds
  that an extension scripts against `talos-cli`'s JSON surface
  and should version and CI alongside it. **Since reversed.** The
  four opt-in extensions that lived in `extensions/` (`flow`,
  `forge`, `ci-shepherd`, `renovate`) were deleted, unused, and the
  one extension the docs now present —
  [fleet](https://github.com/Thurbeen/fleet) — is a template you
  clone, which a control plane has to be: it is the user's own
  private repo, not a directory in ours. What the original
  reasoning was really protecting is the CLI's JSON surface being a
  tested contract, and that is guarded by its own tests either way.
  `extensions/` now holds only the two built-ins (`hooks`,
  `ui-skill`), whose assets the binary `include_str!`s, and
  `install` grew the `git+<repo>` source form (ADR-21) so an
  out-of-repo extension is an ordinary install.

## ADR-21: Declarative extension manifests + first-class lifecycle

**Choice**: Extend ADR-20 by teaching the core a single declarative
**manifest format** (`extension.toml`, `session::ExtensionDef`) and a
first-class lifecycle on the public surface:
`talos-cli extension install/uninstall/activate/deactivate/list/status`
(`session_ops::*`, `agent::extension_config`). The manifest has an
*install* half (`home`, `[[agents]]`, `[[files]]`, `[[symlinks]]`) and a
*runtime* half (`[[sessions]]`, `[[automations]]`). `install` resolves a
source (a bare name → the official repo pinned to the binary's release
tag; a path; or an `http(s)://` base — fetched via `curl`/`wget`), lays
down the payload, registers agents (append-only, comment-preserving),
writes the home-resolved manifest to the discovery dir, and activates.
Active extensions are recorded in SQLite `metadata` and **self-healed**
(missing sessions/automations recreated) at TUI startup and on every
`automation tick`. The core still knows the *format*, never a specific
extension, so an extension's own `install.sh` is a thin shim over the CLI.
The bare-name registry (`OFFICIAL_EXTENSIONS`) is empty today — nothing
ships under a bare name — and the resolver is unchanged: an extension
installs from a path, an `http(s)://` base, or a repository.

**Why**: ADR-20 left each extension to reimplement bootstrap in bespoke
shell, and gave no way to recover from a half-removed extension. Folding
the mechanics behind one data-driven command makes install reproducible
and uninstall symmetric, and self-heal makes an active extension robust
against accidental deletion — all while staying extension-neutral
(reusing `spawn_session_headless`, `db.create_automation`, `AgentDef`).
Pinning the fetch to the binary's release tag keeps a fetched extension
in sync with the binary that reads it.

**Rejected**:

- *Embedding extension assets in the binary* (the option ADR-20
  rejected) — still rejected; `install` fetches **data** at runtime, it
  does not bake assets in, so the agent-neutral core is preserved.
- *Adding an HTTP client dependency* — `curl`/`wget` shell-out matches
  the existing installer and keeps the dependency tree small.
- *Re-serializing `agents.toml` to add/remove agents* — would drop user
  comments/formatting; the installer edits text (append on install,
  block-removal by name on uninstall) instead.

### Install and lifecycle mechanics

The capabilities that reach outside the extension home, the installer's
resolution order, the `extension` CLI surface, versioning/staleness, and the
self-heal pass. The `talos-extensions` skill keeps a summary and points here.

Three install-spec capabilities exist for reaching **outside** the extension
home (added for the built-in hooks extension): `[[external_files]]` places
a file into an agent's own config dir (absolute / `~` / `{home}` path,
guarded by `requires_dir` so it's skipped when that agent isn't installed);
`[[agent_patches]]` appends args to an **existing** agent in
agents.toml (`apply_agent_patches` via `toml_edit`, reversible — uninstall
removes exactly the injected subsequence); and `[[config_merges]]`
**reversibly deep-merges** a shipped document into an agent's own *shared*
config file (`{path, source, requires_dir}`) — for agents whose hooks live in
a file that would be clobbered by `[[external_files]]` (antigravity's
`settings.json`). JSON by default (`agent::json_merge`); `format = "toml"`
selects `agent::toml_merge` (`toml_edit`, preserving the user's comments and
key order) for an agent whose shared config is TOML (kimi's
`~/.kimi-code/config.toml`). Either way the merge recurses objects/tables,
unions arrays by deep-equality, and leaves a user's conflicting value
untouched; uninstall **prunes by marker**, but the two formats mark
differently. JSON matches a marker in the entry's *content* (every shipped
hook command contains `talos-cli session signal`) — the only handle a
format without comments offers. TOML marks *ownership* with a comment on the
entry (`agent::toml_merge`), which a content match cannot do: it tells our
entry from a user hook that calls `session signal` itself, and still
recognises ours after its event or command changes. So the TOML install
prunes-then-merges, replacing our previous entries rather than accumulating
beside them — no orphans either way, and no collateral. Writes are
skipped when unchanged (it re-runs every startup + heartbeat tick). All
three are honoured by `session_ops::install_extension` /
`session_ops::uninstall_extension`.

`talos-cli extension install <name|url|dir> [--home <dir>] [--force]`
(`session_ops::install_extension`) is the one-command installer: it
resolves the source (`agent::extension_config::resolve_source` — a bare
name → the official source `official_base()/<name>` over curl/wget,
**pinned to the binary's release tag** (`main` for dev builds) so a
fetched extension matches the binary; a path → a local dir), fetches + lays
down the payload files (`executable`/`if_absent`/`substitute` flags; paths
validated against traversal — no absolute/`..`), creates the symlinks, registers
the agents (`ensure_agents_registered` appends to agents.toml, preserving
existing entries), writes the home-resolved manifest to the discovery dir, and
activates. A `substitute` file the user edited (managed marker removed) is not
clobbered on reinstall unless `--force`. A **bare-name** install that can't fetch
its manifest becomes a discovery error
(`agent::extension_config::unknown_extension_help`: names `OFFICIAL_EXTENSIONS`
and offers a Levenshtein "did you mean?" when that registry has entries; while it
is empty, it names the URL / path / `git+` forms that do resolve instead).
`uninstall <name> [--purge]` reverses install: tear down session + automation,
remove the extension's agents (`remove_agents_from_toml`, text-edit to preserve
comments), delete the manifest, `--purge` also the home dir. `reinstall <name>
[--purge]` (`session_ops::reinstall_extension`) is the clean-slate hammer —
uninstall + fresh `install --force` from the recorded source (rewriting even
user-edited seed/`substitute` files) — heavier than `update --force`, which only
refreshes payload files in place. An extension's own
`install.sh` is a thin shim over `install`.

`talos-cli extension` (alias `ext`) — `install` / `uninstall <name>
[--purge]` / `reinstall <name> [--purge]` / `list` / `available [<query>]`
(alias `search`) / `update [<name>] [--all] [--force]` (no name ⇒ all) /
`activate <name>` / `deactivate <name> [--force] [--purge]` / `status [<name>]`
— wraps `session_ops::extensions`: `ensure_extension` idempotently (re)creates
any missing declared resource (reusing `spawn_session_headless` +
`db.create_automation`, matching by name so existing ones are reused);
`activate_extension` also records the name in the SQLite `metadata`
`active_extensions` JSON set; `deactivate_extension` tears the resources
down and clears the set. The CLI layer arms the tmux automation heartbeat
on activate so a `Send` automation actually fires headlessly. `available`
lists the official extensions (`OFFICIAL_EXTENSIONS`) for discovery — offline,
with an `installed` flag and ready-to-run `install_command` per entry. Every
mutating subcommand's JSON carries a human-readable `summary` line (and
`list`/`status` surface each extension's `description`).

**Versioning + update.** A manifest declares its own `version` and a
`min_talos_version` (soft compat gate — install/activate/heal *warn*,
never block, if the binary is older). The installer stamps two provenance
fields into the discovery-dir copy: `installed_with` (the talos version that
installed it) and `source` (the resolved install target). After a talos upgrade
the on-disk copy is older than the binary, so `ExtensionDef::is_stale` flags it
(`extension list`/`status`, plus a self-heal nudge). With `[features] auto_update`
on (the same flag that self-updates the binary), the self-heal pass —
`heal_one_extension`, run on TUI startup **and** the headless `automation tick` —
goes past the nudge and **refreshes the stale extension in place** (calls
`update_extension`); the `is_stale` gate is local/network-free, so a refresh
fetches at most once per extension per binary version. `update_extension` re-runs
`install_extension` from the recorded `source` — a bare name re-resolves against
the *new* binary's release tag — preserving user-edited files unless `--force`;
`update_all_extensions` does every installed one. Version helpers
(`compare_versions`, `is_dev_version`, `is_stale`, `compat_warning`) are pure
functions in `session::extension_def`; dev builds (`0.0.0-dev`) skip
staleness/compat since their version doesn't order against tags. No
version-snapshot store: rollback = pin a tagged install URL or downgrade the
binary + `update`.

**Self-heal**: `session_ops::heal_active_extensions` re-ensures every active
extension, called at **TUI startup** (`coordinator/boot.rs`, before session restore so healed
sessions are adopted normally) and at the top of the headless **`automation
tick`** (`cli/automations.rs`, so healing works with the TUI closed via the
heartbeat keeper). Consequence: while an extension is active, deleting its
session/automation is a no-op — they're recreated (a startup toast says so);
`extension deactivate` is the real off-switch. A declared session is recreated
only when its **name is free on the local backend** — the question
`--on-existing` asks of a `session create`, asked here through the shared
`session_ops::names` and answered by refusing. The pass reuses a live namesake,
declines while a soft delete's undo window is still open (the delete can still
be taken back, and a creation inside it is a pair the moment it is), and holds an
expiring claim across the spawn so a second healer — TUI startup beside the
keeper's tick — cannot look, miss and create alongside the first; `session
restore` holds and asks the same three, on local rows only. Each refusal is
reported the way a repair is; the lookup used to span every backend and be taken
into a snapshot before a spawn that runs for tens of seconds, which put two
sessions of one name on one backend and let a namesake on another machine answer
for the local one. Headless healing requires
`[features] automations = true` (the heartbeat); with it off, healing happens only
at TUI startup. An extension's own installer delegates its bootstrap to
`extension activate <name>` rather than reimplementing it.

## ADR-22: `App` decomposition — coordinator + per-domain sub-modules

> **Superseded by ADR-23 — and then re-applied.** `src/app/` was deleted with
> v1, but the pressure this ADR answered recurred exactly as predicted: the
> kernel's `main.rs` grew a ~3.4k-line `impl App`, and the same medicine was
> taken — `App` and its state stay in `main.rs`, its methods live in
> `src/coordinator/` split by purpose (loop/workers, commands, publish, draw,
> input, mouse, focus, interface — plus boot, chrome and editor, `main`'s
> startup and terminal-side helpers), and there is still exactly one model and
> one loop. Unlike `app`, the coordinator is **not** `EXEMPT`: it has its own
> entry in `tests/architecture_rules.rs` listing the layers it wires
> (`docs/CONSTITUTION.md` §2). The rejected alternatives below still stand.

**Choice**: Keep the single `App` model (ADR-1, TEA) but split its
~11.7k-line `app/mod.rs` into per-domain sub-files under `src/app/`,
relocating cohesive `impl App` method clusters out of `mod.rs` while the
state they own lives in small per-cluster sub-structs. `app` stays one
**EXEMPT** module in `tests/architecture_rules.rs` (the coordinator that
imports every layer), and governance is directory-level, so the new
`app/*.rs` files introduce **no** new cross-layer edges and need no
allowlist entries — the split is entirely intra-`app`.

Two halves:

- *State* — already mostly done: `task_ui: TaskUiState`, `automation_ui:
  AutomationUiState`, `new_session: NewSessionWizardState`,
  `global_search: GlobalSearchState`, `worktree_sync: WorktreeSyncState`,
  `metrics`, `notification_state`. Two remain to extract: a new
  `PointerState` (text-selection / click-target / scrollbar / hover
  registries) and a `SpawnController` holding **only** the
  background-task machinery (`worktree_create`/`session_spawn` + their
  `pending_*`).
- *Behavior* — relocate the method clusters into domain files:
  `app/tasks.rs`, `app/automation.rs`, finish `app/search.rs`,
  `app/mouse.rs`, `app/worktree_sync.rs` + `app/git_stats.rs`, and
  `app/spawn.rs`. Methods stay `impl App` (they coordinate side effects);
  only pure state/logic lands on the sub-structs.

**The spine stays on `App`** (clusters borrow it, never own it): the
session vector + selection cursor (`sessions`, `active_index`), the
backend registry (`backends`), per-session render views
(`session_terminal_views`), the render-loop flags (`needs_redraw`,
`last_draw_at`, `last_output_gen`), the status/order caches
(`cached_hook_states`/`hook_states_version`, `cached_session_order`,
`last_active_session_id`, `spinner_frame`), and
`metrics`/`db`/`session_counter`/`terminal_rows`. The TEA methods
(`update`, `tick`, `view`, `handle_key`/`dispatch_action`, `new`,
`shutdown`), session restore/adopt, and all navigation/status/ordering
stay too — navigation *is* manipulation of the shared cursor. Two
cross-cluster handoff slots stay explicit and `pub(crate)`:
`pending_task_prompt` (tasks↔spawn) and `deferred_inputs`
(spawn/sync/paste).

**The spawn boundary**: `SpawnController` owns only its background tasks
and exposes `poll() -> SpawnEvent` (`WorktreesReady`/`Spawned`/`Failed`);
`App` applies the event via the existing `finalize_spawned_session`. The
controller never owns session *adoption* — that body touches `sessions`,
`active_index`, `focus`, `db`, `deferred_inputs`, `metrics`, and
`task_ui` in one place, and pushing it into a sub-struct would re-create
the god-object through a `&mut App` parameter.

**Order** (each its own PR, green throughout; `app/acceptance.rs` is the
safety net): (1) tasks → (2) automations → (3) search — the safe
relocations, state already extracted — then (4) mouse (first new
sub-struct), (5) sync, (6) spawn (machinery only; last and hardest).
Because all relocations carve from the same `mod.rs`/`key_handlers.rs`,
they are **sequenced**, not run in parallel, so each rebases onto the
prior cleanly.

**Why**: `mod.rs` is the repo's hottest merge-conflict file and
interleaves spawn/mouse/task/automation/sync/metrics, so no single flow
can be read without scrolling past four others. The split shrinks
`mod.rs` toward a coordinator + spine (~5–6k lines) with each domain's
invariants local, and *strengthens* the TEA spirit — side effects stay
concentrated at the coordinator, pure state/logic gets isolated — rather
than bending it. The state half is already underway, so most of the work
is mechanical relocation against existing tests: low risk, high
readability gain.

**Rejected**:

- *Splitting `App` into multiple models / TEA loops* — breaks ADR-1's
  single `update`/`view` and the `data_version`-driven redraw; the
  coupling is real (every cluster reads the selection cursor), so one
  model with a borrowed spine is correct.
- *Owning the spine in sub-controllers* (e.g. a `SessionController`
  owning `sessions`/`active_index`) — every other cluster borrows it, so
  this merely relocates the god-object and forces `&mut App`-style
  params everywhere.
- *Pushing side-effecting methods onto the sub-structs* — would drag
  `db`/`sessions`/`deferred_inputs` into each cluster and reintroduce the
  coupling; behavior stays `impl App`, only pure logic moves.
- *One big relocation PR* — unreviewable and merge-hostile; the value is
  in independently-reviewable, test-green increments.

## ADR-23: The interface is a Lua plugin kernel

**Choice**: `talos` boots a Rust kernel that renders whatever Lua plugins it
finds under `ui/`. There is no built-in pane — the session list, the agent
terminal and the search strip are files a user can edit, move, turn off, delete or
replace. v1's `src/app` (TEA) and `src/ui` (35 render modules) were deleted;
`session`, `agent`, `storage`, `git`, `session_ops` and `cli` are unchanged.

**Why**: every surface v1 grew had to be built, styled, keybound and tested in
Rust, so the interface was the bottleneck on its own evolution and a user who
wanted a different pane had no move available short of a fork. Making panes data
moves that cost to a file, and the constraint that makes it safe is that a plugin
is handed a snapshot and returns a tree — it never gets the world.

Five rules carry it, each load-bearing:

1. **Four node kinds** — `text`, `box`, `input`, `surface`; everything else
   composes in Lua. A prior attempt froze its catalog at six and reached sixteen,
   because it never built the userland layer.
2. **Layout resolves before render**, so a plugin knows its own rect and can wrap,
   truncate and window. Sizes are declared *statically*, which breaks the
   circularity.
3. **Snapshot-read, command-write** — Lua never blocks, so no plugin, including
   one nobody has written, can stall the loop on SQLite, git or a dead host.
4. **Capabilities by absence** — an ungranted capability is not in the
   environment. Enforced statically by `talos.yml` as well as at runtime.
5. **Anything touching the world runs on a worker.**

**The name is the constraint on how this shipped.** The updater in an installed
binary hard-fails on a known binary missing from a release archive and swallows the
error, so an archive that dropped the name `talos` would silently end auto-update
for every install already out there, unfixably. The kernel therefore inherited the
name rather than shipping beside it, and a profile with v1 history meets a one-time
gate (`kernel::consent`) before anything changes. See `docs/RELEASING.md`.

**Cost, accepted**: a frame is more expensive — every pane is a Lua call returning a
table that is converted and painted — so the loop settles aggressively and every
cached answer carries an age. And v1 surfaces are owed rather than ported: the
file viewer has no equivalent, and tasks, automations and the restore list are
`talos-cli` only. Code review and the info panel came back the way the design
intended — as panes, outside the binary:
[`talos-code-review`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-code-review) and
[`talos-info-panel`](https://github.com/zatzk/talos-info-panel), each its
own repository, installed by clone.

**Rejected**:

- *A config file describing panes* — expressive enough for arrangement, never for
  behaviour; every new interaction would have become a new key.
- *Shipping v2 beside v1 as a second binary* — auto-update never introduces a new
  binary, so it would have reached almost nobody, and two interfaces on one
  database doubles the surface every engine change has to satisfy.
- *An embedded scripting language with the host's capabilities* — the point of
  rule 4 is that a plugin someone else wrote is safe to load.

## ADR-24: A host's database owns its sessions; a remote talos is a client

**Choice**: A session that runs on a shareable host is a row in **that host's**
talos database, whoever created it. A talos reaching the host from
elsewhere *mirrors* that database (`session list --json` + `--deleted`) into
local rows on `ssh:<name>` / `wsl:<name>` — same id, the host's facts and hook
status — and performs every write there by running the host's own
`talos-cli`: `session create|delete|restart|restore`, inside the four
`session_ops` pipelines, so every caller delegates without knowing it
(`session_ops::host_cli`, `session_ops::mirror`). A host with no CLI is
**provisioned** one: the release archive of this binary's version for the
host's platform, checksum-verified by the code `talos-cli update` uses,
placed under `~/.local/share/talos/bin/` on the host — never on PATH — and
then **asked for its version before the provisioning counts as one**. That
checksum is taken on *this* machine and nothing checked what landed on the
host, so a `talos-cli` that was 54% of itself was installed, logged as
`provisioned talos-cli <version>` and left to segfault under every later
probe. A
host where that cannot be done (a dev build on a foreign platform, no
network, a different schema) or with `share_sessions = false` is used exactly
as ADR-13 describes: worktrees over ssh, the hooks rewrite, the pane-option
status channel, which are now the **legacy path for non-shareable hosts**.

The verdict is cached per host, and a failing one **backs off**:
`host_cli::retry_after` doubles `PROBE_RETRY` (60 s) per consecutive failure
up to `PROBE_RETRY_MAX` (15 min), the count reset by the first usable answer
and by `forget` (what `session sync` calls, since somebody running it by hand
has usually just fixed the host). A flat interval was wrong because the
failures divide in two and only one of them is transient: a host that is
rebooting answers on the next pass, while a host whose shell will not take a
10 MB payload fails *identically* every time — and each of those attempts
re-downloaded the release archive and opened an ssh, once a minute, for as
long as talos ran. The transfer itself reaps its transport child on both
paths (`git::stream_into_child`, killing it first when the write failed):
`Child`'s `Drop` neither kills nor waits, so returning on the `EPIPE`
`write_all` saw left one orphaned `ssh` per attempt. It also reports the
peer's own stderr in preference to that `EPIPE`, which is the symptom of the
remote dying and never the reason.

**A host whose CLI does not run is not a host that is down**, and folding the
two together is what made such a host permanently broken: the failed probe
cached a `No`, an unusable host's mirror pass is skipped, and that mirror is
the only caller that reaches provisioning — so the corrupt binary disabled the
one mechanism that would have replaced it, while the backoff made the log
quieter rather than the host better. The probe's line protocol therefore
carries `@status <n>`, what the binary it found exited with, and
`host_cli::ProbeFailure` says whether the host answered at all: a probe that
found a broken CLI falls through to provisioning exactly as a host with no CLI
does, and a host that genuinely did not answer still backs off as above.

**Why**: two taloses already shared a host's tmux server — a laptop spawning
on `ssh:devbox` and a talos on devbox both use `tmux -L talos` there —
but each kept its own database, so each saw only what it made. The laptop
did everything *to* the host from afar because nothing of talos was assumed
to exist there; that is also why a host with its own talos could not see
those sessions. Every other remote tool solves this the same way: the host
owns its records and the client asks. Once "talos-cli on the host" stopped
being an obstacle, the host's database already had what a shared session
needs — `deleted_at`, `force_deleted`, `restore`, `hook_state` — and the
laptop-driven remote path shrank to a fallback.

**Rejected**:

- *Stamp each session's facts on its tmux window and reconcile from the
  server* (the first draft of the change). No host requirement, but the tmux
  server is a volatile store with no notion of deleted or restored, so it
  needed tombstones with a TTL, a claim protocol for relaunch after a reboot,
  a lowest-pane-id rule, a pane-id heuristic for undo and a probe before
  relaunch — every one a consequence of the store.
- *Read and write the host's SQLite file from afar.* SQLite's locking needs
  the writer on the file's own filesystem; a copy-back loses whatever a host
  process wrote in between.
- *`sqlite3` on the host.* No likelier to be installed than talos, and the
  schema and every rule twice.

**Consequences**: the id is the host's, so `TALOS_SESSION` inside the agent
matches a row in whichever database a `talos-cli` on that machine reaches —
`session signal` and `message send` work natively on the host for a session
created from afar, and the psmux status gate (`Psmux::HOOK_STATUS`, ADR-32) is not consulted
for a shared Windows host. Relaunch after a reboot is the host's
(`session restart --if-missing`, idempotent across observers). The mirror
writes nothing when nothing changed. Status keeps its sub-second channel on
hosts whose backend has a status channel because `session signal` also records
the state in the row's backend (`SessionBackend::record_hook_state` — on tmux,
the pane option a peer's subscription reads; ADR-32). A fork — which resumes
the parent's conversation in the parent's checkout, two facts the host's
`create` does not take — stays on the legacy path and is registered on the
host by `session sync --adopt`, as is
any session created before this change. `session register` is the one place
a row is made for a window that already runs, and it refuses to launch.

Reconciliation has a direction, and delegation has a fallback. Three rules
follow from the host owning the record, none of which the first cut had:

- **A local tombstone is a decision, not a gap.** The mirror read "the host
  lists it as active" as "restore it", so a delete taken while the host's CLI
  was in backoff — or while sharing was off — was undone on the next pass, and
  on every pass after. The listing carries `updated_at` for the ordering the
  two sides otherwise lack: the host's row wins only when the host wrote it
  *after* this database's own last-known reading of that same host's clock for
  that row (schema v45's `host_updated_at`, snapshotted whenever this database
  adopts, restores, or applies a change to the row from the host's listing).
  Otherwise the tombstone stands and the delete is pushed to the host
  as `session delete`, the symmetric counterpart of `session sync --adopt`'s
  `register_unknown` — and unconditional where that one is opt-in, since a
  delete the host never hears is a window running there forever. Ordering
  against a prior reading of the *same* clock, rather than the host's
  `updated_at` against this machine's `deleted_at`, is what keeps the two
  sides' independent clocks out of the comparison: a slower or faster host
  clock changes nothing, since both readings came from it. The one row for
  which there is no prior reading — a session deleted before this database
  ever mirrored it from that host — still falls back to comparing against
  local `deleted_at`, the same approximation the comparison used everywhere
  before v45.
- **A session is its id; a row is one path to it.** A host lists the
  sessions it mirrors from hosts of its own beside its own, under its own
  `ssh:`/`wsl:` names, and every hop keeps the id. Taking every row a host
  lists meant one database row per id was relabelled by whichever pass ran
  last: with A → B → C and A → C, C's session moved between `ssh:<b>` and
  `ssh:<c>` every ten seconds, and a B that mirrored A back relabelled A's own
  *local* sessions as B's. `mirror::reconcile_with` takes a host's own rows as
  before and a transitive one only when this database holds its id on no
  other path, active or deleted — so the direct path, and this instance's own
  rows, always win, and a delete taken on the direct path is not revived
  through another. A transitive row drops its pane id (a pane on the further
  host's server, which on this host's server names someone else's agent) and
  marks its checkouts borrowed; everything done to it goes through the host's
  CLI, which delegates to the owner. Showing them is the default;
  `settings.toml` `[remote] transitive_sessions = false` shows only each
  host's own, and *forgets* the rows already taken (`Database::forget_session`,
  the one path that removes a session row) — a tombstone there would be
  pushed to the host as a delete of a live session that is not ours.
- **"The host does not know this row" is not a failure to delete.** The host
  resolves the id against its *active* rows, so a fork minted here, a
  pre-ADR-24 row, and one a peer already deleted all answer "Session not
  found". Aborting on it left the local row active and attached. It falls
  through to the local teardown instead, recorded in the report's
  `host_unknown`. A delegated call that never reached the host at all — a
  transport failure, not a reply — falls through the same way, recorded in
  `host_unreachable` instead: the alternative left the local row active with
  nothing recorded for the owed-teardown sweep (below) to retry, the same
  orphan that sweep exists to stop, reached through the delegated door instead
  of the legacy one. Any *other* host error still aborts, because the session
  may still be running there.
- **A soft delete is reaped on the host.** Nothing reaps a soft-deleted row but
  the sweep (`session_ops::reap_overdue_soft_deletes`), and a host running only
  `talos-cli` runs it only on its heartbeat — so on a host with neither the
  undo window never closed there and every remote soft delete leaked its
  windows. `session reap <ref>`
  is that operation as a verb, and a peer calls it once the undo window is up
  (a non-shareable host's windows are killed directly instead). A remote
  teardown also never calls `ensure_ready`, which would *create* the server
  and the talos session on the host as a side effect of tearing one down,
  and acts only on a socket the host has vouched for (`known_host_socket`).
- **A teardown that never reached its host is owed, not abandoned.** Killing
  something on a machine you cannot reach is not a promise software can make,
  and an unreachable host is often *why* someone force-deletes — so the delete
  still goes through. What it stopped doing is writing the loss off at that
  moment: schema v46's `sessions.teardown_owed` records it, and
  `session_ops::retry_owed_remote_teardowns` — driven by the same two callers
  as the reap — finishes the kill and the worktree removals when the host next
  answers. Without it that one best-effort attempt was the only one anything
  would ever make: every reaper skips a `force_deleted` row, and the tombstone
  push above needs a shareable host with a usable CLI, so a host on the legacy
  path kept the agent running for good. Force-deleted rows only — a
  soft-deleted one is restorable and its windows are the reaper's to take at
  the end of the undo window, and a second sweep killing them on its own
  schedule would make the undo hand back a session with nothing running in it.
  The mark is only ever set by an attempt that failed, never by a migration:
  an upgraded database cannot say which of its past force deletes left
  something behind, and inventing owed teardowns for all of them would send
  the sweep after windows that are long gone.
- **"The host holds nothing" and "the host did not answer" are different
  answers.** `discover` gates its listing on `has-session` and reads its
  failure as an empty server, but over a transport `ssh` exits non-zero for a
  refused connection, a timeout and a rejected key alike. A force delete taken
  while a host was briefly down therefore found nothing to kill, recorded *no
  error at all*, and reported success — the leak above, with the operator told
  nothing. `tmux_compat::Server::discover_answered` — what `discover` runs whenever
  no control-mode connection is open, and what `locate` and `rename_windows`
  list with — returns an empty listing only when the multiplexer itself
  refused. It also replaces the `has-session` round trip, since `list-windows`
  on an absent server gives exactly that refusal. The same listing is what
  `restart_session`'s `--if-missing` path asks whether the agent is gone and
  needs relaunching — an unreachable host now aborts the relaunch instead of
  reading as "no window", which used to start a second agent beside the one
  still running once the host answered again.
- **The layer that failed decides, not the words it used.** Both classifications
  above began as substring matches over an error message, and a message is
  written for a person: the first unanticipated wording lands in the wrong
  branch, silently, in whichever direction happens to be worse. So the question
  is asked of the layer instead. `ssh` exits **255** for its own failures and
  passes a remote command's status through untouched (a remote `exit 7` exits
  7), and `talos-cli` only ever exits 1, 2 or 3 — so 255 is ssh saying the
  question never arrived, whatever the stderr underneath resembles
  (`backend::tmux_compat::server::listing_is_absence`, `session_ops::host_cli::classify_failure`).
  `session_ops::host_cli::Reach` names the three answers a failed remote call
  can have — `Unreached`, `Answered`, `Undetermined` — and `Undetermined` is
  deliberately its own answer rather than being rounded to the nearest of the
  other two. Where a substring test is still the only signal (tmux's own
  refusals) it is narrowed to the exact answers the tool is documented to give;
  widening that list is the trap it looks like a fix, since each new string
  makes the classifier more confidently wrong about the next one nobody
  anticipated. `wsl.exe` has no 255 convention, so a WSL host is never called
  `Unreached` on a status alone — the honest limit rather than a guess, and a
  cheap one, since `wsl.exe` runs on this machine.
- **What an unclassifiable failure does depends on which branch destroys
  nothing**, and that is not the same branch everywhere. For a listing,
  "unanswered" must not become "the server holds nothing", so it is an error
  and the teardown is recorded as owed. For a *delegated delete* it is the
  reverse: aborting reaches nothing and records nothing, which is how a session
  on a host with a broken CLI became undeletable, so `Undetermined` falls back
  to the local teardown alongside `Unreached` — stamp-addressed, so on a host
  that is up (exit 127, reached it and found no `talos-cli`) it still takes
  exactly this session's windows, and on one that is not it records the owed
  teardown. Only `Answered` aborts: the host is up, heard the question and
  refused, so the session may still be running there. A host too old to write
  the structured `{"error": …}` document is still read as having answered, from
  its exit code being one of the CLI's own.
- **Known limit: tmux's absence is a claim about the socket, not the machine.**
  A tmux server with live panes whose socket file is moved or replaced reports
  `error connecting to <path> (No such file or directory)` — verified against a
  real host with two live processes still running behind it. talos addresses
  sessions only through that socket, so there is no command it could issue to
  reach those windows and no retry that would ever discharge such an owed
  teardown; treating it as absence is therefore the right answer, but it is the
  narrower claim *nothing is reachable through this socket*. Closing the gap
  would need a way to identify a session's processes without the multiplexer —
  a recorded OS pid per remote pane, or a scan by worktree cwd — which nothing
  here has today. What the narrowing does buy is the case where a retry *does*
  help: `(Permission denied)` / `(Connection refused)` / `(Connection reset by
  peer)` behind that same `error connecting to` prefix are a server that may be
  alive and reachable once the condition clears, and those are no longer read
  as absence.

## ADR-25: A window's identity is a stamp on the window, not its name

**Choice**: every talos tmux window carries two window options written at
spawn — `@talos_session`, the id of the session row that owns it, and
`@talos_role` (`agent` / `shell` / `program`). `discover`'s format string
reads both, `WindowIndex` (`backend::identity`) indexes a listing by
`(session id, role)`, and every reconciler that used to resolve `tb-<name>`
asks it instead. The answer is three-valued: **at** a pane, **absent**, or
**unknown** — several windows answer to the name and at least one carries no
stamp. Nothing may read `unknown` as absence.

**Where it lives**: the rule is backend-neutral, so it is not the tmux
adapter's. The role vocabulary (`WindowRole`) and the listing a backend
answers with (`DiscoveredSession`) are contract values
(`backend::contract`); talos's window-naming convention (`tb-` / `tbs-` /
`tbp-` and `sanitize_window_name`, which is also the name-uniqueness rule in
`session_ops::names`) and the resolution rule (`WindowIndex`, `Located`) are
`backend::identity`, which depends on the contract and nothing else. How a
stamp is *stored* is an adapter's business: tmux keeps it in the two window
options above, and a backend with no window options leaves every window
unstamped and resolvable by name as before. Moving the code changed no value
on a live server — the prefixes and both option names are what running
windows already carry, and changing either would orphan them. It used to live
inside `agent::tmux`, which made the contract and the tmux adapter import each
other; `tests/architecture_rules.rs` now fails on that cycle.

**Why**: a window's only identity was its name, and a name is neither unique
nor injective. Two sessions may legitimately be given one (`--on-existing
allow`, and ADR-24 mirrors a host's names verbatim), and
`sanitize_window_name` maps everything outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` to `_`, so
`fleet 1` and `fleet_1` share `tb-fleet_1`. `sessions.backend_id` was the
precise half, but tmux reissues pane ids from `%0` whenever its server
starts, so a row's remembered `%N` can be a live namesake's pane afterwards —
and the check that was supposed to catch that (does the pane sit in a window
of the right *name*) confirms nothing when the two sessions share the name.
Six reconcilers keyed on the name, and every teardown path — reap, force
delete, `stop`, `restart`, spawn rollback — could therefore kill a live
session's window. That is the "deleting a frozen session kills its
replacement 30-60s later, and each delete-and-recreate makes the next one die
sooner" report. A window option is the same fact stored once, on the thing it
describes, and it is the channel a tmux-protocol backend's hook status uses
too (ADR-32).

**Rejected**:

- *A `session_window_claims` table* (the first fix, replaced by this one).
  It answered "does any other row still answer to this pane id or this name"
  from the database, which is a second store to keep in step with tmux: a
  claim is written by a spawn and never released, so after one soft delete of
  `review` every later `review` whose pane id is unusable — every row on
  psmux, every row after a tmux restart — was refused a reap forever. It also
  only ever gated the *reap*; the other four teardown paths kept killing by
  name.
- *A pane-id tie-break inside an ambiguous name* — "the row remembers `%1`,
  and `%1` is one of the two `tb-fleet` panes, so take it". This is exactly
  the unsound step the reissued-id bug walks through, and keeping it would
  have made the strict path a special case rather than the rule.
- *Renaming windows to something unique.* The window name is what a person
  reads in `tmux ls` and what a hand-run `tmux attach` reaches for; a uuid
  there is a worse tool for a fix that does not need it.

**Consequences**: `sessions.backend_id` is demoted to a hint — it is what the
interface attaches to, not what a teardown targets, and no code resolves
ownership through it. `discover` now lists `tbs-` and `tbp-` windows too:
leaving them out is what let a name look unambiguous when it was not, and the
*role*, not the listing, is what keeps a plugin's program from ever resolving
as somebody's agent. Ambiguity that used to relaunch now refuses: a session
whose name cannot be resolved is left alone rather than given a second agent.
Migration is the sole-namesake rule — an unstamped window is adoptable only
while it is the only one with that name, and it is stamped on adoption
(`restore`'s adopt, `session register`), so a pre-ADR-25 window converts on
first use. psmux (ADR-13) has no usable window options, so the name fallback
stands there — the one place it still does, matching the shape of the other
psmux carve-outs. "No usable window options" had been read as "a stamp written
there is simply lost"; it is not, and that cost every Windows pane
(issue #1168). psmux keeps a *global* option under the name and answers
`#{@...}` with it for every window, so the stamp has to be withheld at both
ends rather than merely expected to fail. And because the stamp
answers for a *role*, the companion shell became reachable: a session owns a
`tb-` and a `tbs-` window, `sessions.shell_backend_id` is written only once
the interface has opened one, and every teardown — force delete, reap, `stop`,
`restart`, `--on-existing replace` — now takes both down through the stamp
rather than through a column that is usually NULL.

**One session, one window per role is enforced, not merely assumed.** The
three-valued answer above only works while that holds, and as first written
nothing kept it: a restart's respawn is kill-then-spawn, and between those two steps
the session is indistinguishable from one whose agent died — which is what every
repairer relaunches. Both then spawned and stamped, one id landed on two
windows, and `unknown` is permanent because the windows stay (issue #1207). Two
mechanisms now, and they answer different halves:

- **The row is held for the length of a restart.** `restart::hold_restart` is
  `Database::claim_session_restart`, the conditional statement
  `claim_session_name` already is (docs/FEATURES.md → "Two creators never reach
  an `--on-existing`") re-keyed on the session id, and a
  `restart --if-missing` declines a row somebody else is replacing the window
  of. It is the only thing the two processes share, and it is what stops a
  second agent from ever being launched onto one conversation. Only a
  *relaunch* declines on it: a hold outlives its holder by minutes by design, so
  refusing an operator's own `session restart` would leave the verb answering
  "already restarting" long after the holder died.
- **A second window carrying a stamp is retired where the stamp is written.**
  `Server::retire_duplicate_windows` (`backend::tmux_compat::server`) runs after every local stamp
  (the headless `create_window`, whose stamp rides in `new-window`'s own
  command list, and `stamp_window` for the interface's own spawn,
  an adopt, a restore and a `session register`) and **the highest window id
  keeps the identity**.
  Not "the window I just made": both racers run the sweep, so "mine wins" has
  each retire the other's and can leave the session no window at all, while a
  key tmux issues in order and never reissues makes every sweep reach the same
  verdict. It also closes the gap between a window being created and being
  stamped — the last stamp to land is followed by a listing that sees every
  earlier one. Liveness is deliberately not the key: it changes between two
  listings taken a moment apart, and a newest window whose pane already exited
  is kept and stays on screen under `remain-on-exit`, which is how the operator
  sees why it exited.

The same sweep runs from the tmux adapter's `locate` before it gives up on an
`unknown`, and
that is what reaches a server **already** carrying a pair — no migration does,
because those windows exist. `WindowIndex` itself is untouched: `stamped_match`
still refuses two, because the repair is a *write* and reading one of two as the
answer is the unsound step the pane-id tie-break was rejected for above. Both
are local tmux only; psmux keeps `@` options in one server-global map, so the
stamp is withheld at both ends there (ADR-13) and a sweep that believed a
listing would retire every window on the server.

## ADR-26: One reaper, and a row is written by the column that changed

**Choice**: the undo window is asked of the database and nowhere else.
`session_ops::reap_overdue_soft_deletes` is the single sweep — every row whose
`deleted_at` is older than `UNDO_WINDOW` and that still owns a window by its
ADR-25 stamp — and both drivers call it: the interface's loop on a slow cadence
(`REAP_INTERVAL`, a `Command::Reap` that names no session) and `talos-cli`'s
heartbeat on its tick. `retry_owed_remote_teardowns` (ADR-24) rides the same two
drivers and is deliberately a *separate* sweep rather than a branch inside this
one: it asks a different durable question (`teardown_owed`, not
`deleted_at + UNDO_WINDOW`) of a disjoint set of rows (force-deleted, which this
sweep skips), and folding the two would put a kill that must not wait for the
undo window in the same pass as one that must. `Command::Reap` is the one command the bus keeps no
in-flight record of — it recurs forever with nobody waiting on it, and a row
there is drawn, captioned and counted as activity (ADR-P22 in
`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`). Alongside it, a caller that changes **one column** of a
session row uses a targeted setter (`set_backend_id`, `set_session_shell`,
`set_display_order`) rather than the full-row `upsert_session`.

The sweep's ownership gate asks each remote host for its windows, and a host
that cannot answer is **backed off** rather than asked again next pass: an
unresolvable host reads as "owns nothing", which is the conservative answer for
one pass but leaves the row unreaped forever, so the sweep kept re-probing at
`REAP_INTERVAL` for the life of the process. `window_index_on` leaves such a
host alone for `host_cli::retry_after` its consecutive failure count — the same
curve the host-usability probe climbs, one minute doubling towards fifteen —
and clears the count the moment the host answers.

That backoff is **durable and claimed**, for the same reason the undo window
itself is asked of the database: the sweep has two drivers and neither is a
single long-lived caller. The interface dispatches `Command::Reap` onto a fresh
thread every five seconds without waiting for the last, so several sweeps sit
inside one listing that is blocked on an ssh connect timeout; and the heartbeat
starts `talos-cli automation tick` as a **new process** every minute, which a
backoff held in memory does not survive at all. So the state is a `metadata`
row per host (`host_probe_backoff:<backend>`), and the eligibility check and the
stamp are one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` — a claim, written before the probe is made, so
that the sweeps arriving behind it collide with the stamp rather than with a
failure nobody has recorded yet. The cost of not doing this was
issue #1182: a single soft-deleted WSL row spawning `wsl.exe` from
`Command::Reap` every five seconds, stalling the interface and writing 3.9 MB of
log in a day.

The **reap itself** is claimed the same way, per row
(`session_reap_backoff:<session id>`). Listing the host and reaping on it are
different questions and a host can answer one and not the other: a WSL distro
whose `talos-cli` was an `ELOOP` symlink answered `list-windows` perfectly, so
the listing never backed off, the row kept owning its windows, and the reap —
and the remote round trip it makes — was repeated on the sweep's own cadence
for the life of the process (issue #1193). Ownership is the sweep's only
idempotence proxy, so "still owns windows" cannot distinguish a reap that has
not run from one that failed; `reap_remote` therefore *reports* its failure
instead of logging it, and the sweep spaces that row out on `retry_after` its
consecutive failures and drops the stamp the moment the reap comes off.

**Why**: there were two reapers answering different questions.
`kernel::reaper::Reaper` fired on *"the id left the snapshot ten seconds ago"*,
which is a proxy for deletion that anything else emptying the snapshot also
armed — a filtered refresh, a failed `data_version` read — and whose state a
restart of the interface simply lost, so a row soft-deleted while no interface
was running was never collected by one. The headless sweep asked the real
question against the durable column. Two answers to one question is a store to
keep in step; the durable one wins, and the in-memory one and its "an undo
cancels the reap" special case both go (a restored row no longer matches
`deleted_at`, which *is* the cancellation).

The full-row write-back is the same shape of problem one layer down.
`upsert_session` carries `deleted_at = NULL` on conflict and replaces every
worktree row, and `restart` and the two ordering commands were using it to
change a single column — so a delete landing between a listing and the loop
that followed it was undone by the very next row written, and every reorder
rewrote every worktree row in the database. Reorder additionally serialised
itself on a `static ORDER_LOCK`, which is process-local and therefore never
protected against a second talos or a `talos-cli` write; the read and the
renumbering are now one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction
(`Database::reorder_sessions`) with the write a single `UPDATE … CASE`, which is
what the mutex was reaching for and could not have.

Every targeted setter now opens through the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
(`Database::write_transaction`), not only `reorder_sessions`. A `BEGIN
DEFERRED` transaction that reads before it writes — `set_backend_id` among
them, and `set_hook_state`, the path every agent hook takes — upgrades to a
write lock mid-flight, and in WAL mode an upgrade whose read snapshot a peer
has already overtaken fails `SQLITE_BUSY` immediately, without consulting
`busy_timeout`. The database is shared by the TUI, `talos-cli` and every
agent hook, so that upgrade race is not rare; taking the lock at `BEGIN`
instead makes the write wait out a peer rather than fail in front of one.

**Rejected**:

- *Keeping the in-memory reaper for its cadence.* It costs nothing per tick,
  which is genuinely cheaper than a SELECT — but the sweep short-circuits before
  it consults any multiplexer when nothing is overdue, and a reap that happens a
  few seconds late is not a defect. Paying a thread and a connection every five
  seconds buys an answer that is right after a restart.
- *Dropping `deleted_at = NULL` from `upsert_session` globally.* `mirror::apply`
  genuinely applies a host's whole row, restore branch included (ADR-24), and it
  is the one caller for which reviving on conflict is the intended meaning.
  Making the *other* callers stop writing whole rows is the smaller change and
  the one that names the real problem.

**Consequences**: `Command::Reap` names no session — it is a sweep, and the
loop no longer holds a list of ids it is waiting on. A restart whose row is
deleted underneath it now fails to record its pane instead of reviving the row,
and says so; the sweep only collects a *soft*-deleted row, so a concurrent
*force* delete would otherwise orphan the window it spawned — the caller kills
that window itself when the record says the row is genuinely gone, rather than
leaning on a sweep that cannot see it. A record that merely *failed to write*
says nothing about the row: the agent that was just spawned is a live process,
and killing it over a transient storage error — which `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` makes
rarer but does not eliminate — is a defect the record's caller must not commit
regardless. `upsert_session` replaces the worktree rows unconditionally,
so a session that loses every worktree stops listing the ones it no longer owns
— it used to skip the replacement for an empty list and keep them forever. And
the reads that fed a relaunch stopped failing open: the `stop` guard, the launch
recipe and the recorded `--env` are read strictly, because a DB error there
relaunched a parked session or launched the default coding agent in place of a
`--command` session's recorded command.

## ADR-27: Several instances on one server — the one being typed into sizes a pane

**Choice**: a pane is the size of the rect **one** instance paints it into, and
every other instance shows that pane's screen as it is. The window names its
sizer in a window option, `@talos_sizer`, and a paint's resize
(`tmux_compat::Server::resize`) is honoured only for a window that is this instance's to
size: one nobody names, one it already names, or any window while it is the only
client attached. Input and focus are what hand the size over — a keystroke,
paste or forwarded click into a pane that is not at this instance's size claims
it outright (`claim_size`), which is tmux's own `window-size latest` with typing
as the activity, and so does the pane **gaining** the focus here
(`Terminals::focus`), whether by a focus key, a click or a session switch. Only
the gain counts: a pane that keeps the focus while another instance takes it
stays that instance's, or two instances focused on one pane would trade it every
frame. Before focus counted, a session focused after another instance had sized
it stayed at that size until the first keystroke. Every instance's vt100 grid
follows the pane's **real** size, read from `%layout-change` and delivered to
the pane's reader in the same channel as its output (`PaneEvent`), so the size
changes between the last byte written for the old one and the first written for
the new. An instance whose rect differs from the grid paints the bottom rows of
a taller grid and blank margins around a smaller one, and says on its bottom row
that another talos is sizing the pane and that typing takes it. When the other
instance goes, the one left takes its own size back once, unprompted.

The decision is **tmux's**, in the command list that carries the resize, so it
costs no round trip and two instances cannot both win it: a `set-option -F`
settles the name (`#{?<may>,<me>,<current>}`), then each resize is an
`if-shell -F` on "the name is me". That shape is fixed on purpose. The control
connection pairs each waiter with a known number of `%begin` blocks, and an
`if-shell` answers with one more block per command it runs — four taken, one
declined for a two-command body (measured, tmux 3.7c). So each `if-shell` wraps
one command and has a one-command `else`: five blocks whichever way it goes.
An inner command that fails does **not** stop the list the way a failing
top-level one does, so the sizes are clamped to what `resize-window` accepts.

Who is sizing is read over a format subscription on
`#{?#{==:#{session_attached},1},,#{@talos_sizer}}` — the name while more
than one client is attached, nothing once one is alone. That is what clears the
hint and triggers the take-back when an instance quits or crashes: v2 has no
per-pane teardown at quit to release a name from, and a crashed instance could
not run one anyway, so the release is computed rather than sent.

**Why**: with two instances on one server — a lead over ssh and one locally, in
terminals of different sizes — each resized every pane to its own rect whenever
that rect changed, including a toast taking a row. The agent re-wrapped at
whichever painted last, and the other instance kept parsing its output into a
grid of its own, different size. Measured on a sandboxed server with two
instances of 100×30 and 160×45: twelve SIGWINCHes in twelve seconds of
alternating rect changes, the agent bouncing between 26×73 and 41×118. After:
six, all from the sizing instance's own rect changes — what a lone instance
would get — and none from the other.

**Rejected alternatives**:

- **Negotiate the minimum** (each instance publishes its viewport, all set the
  smallest). Deterministic, but every instance gets the smallest screen all the
  time, and a published viewport needs pruning when its instance dies without
  saying so — the same staleness problem, with a worse steady state.
- **A fixed size for shared sessions.** Simple, and the agent never re-wraps,
  but it changes a lone instance's behaviour and asks the operator to pick a
  number that is wrong for one of their terminals.
- **First attached owns it.** Never hands over: the instance you are actually
  working in stays letterboxed for as long as the other one lives.
- **Keep the grid at the rect and resize nothing.** The grid then parses output
  laid out for another width — the garbling this replaces.

**Consequences**: the instance not being typed into shows a cropped or
letterboxed view, and switching which one you type into re-wraps the agent once.
Two instances restarted together find a name left by an instance that is gone,
and neither is alone, so the pane stays at that size until one of them is typed
into. "Alone" counts every client attached to the session, so a plain
`tmux attach` on talos's socket makes a lone instance wait for input the same
way. A lone instance behaves as it always did, with one difference: its grid
now takes a new size when tmux reports it (a round trip later) rather than when
it asked. That frame shows the old grid in the new rect; the bytes that follow
are laid out for the new size, which is when the grid needs it. psmux has no
`if-shell -F`, no format subscriptions and no `%layout-change` to read, so on a
Windows host the last instance to paint still wins, as before.

## ADR-28: A session's route is one typed value, read one way

**Choice**: `sessions.backend_type` is parsed by exactly one function,
`session::Route::parse`, into a **machine** (local, `ssh:<host>`,
`wsl:<distro>`) and an optional **multiplexer**; `Route::format` is its only
writer. The grammar and each spelling's meaning are in `docs/CONFIG.md` →
*Multiplexer choice and existing sessions*. A row written before routes named
their multiplexer is **unqualified**, and `Route::multiplexer` settles it the
way such rows were always read: the platform default locally, psmux for a host
configured `psmux` and tmux for any other. New rows are written qualified. One
resolver finds a row's host, `HostRegistry::host_of`, and returns it exactly as
configured. The backend registry is keyed by qualified `Route` and looks up
only the route it is asked for; `backend::wiring` registers every adapter for
this machine and for every host (ADR-31), and the platform default and a host's
preference decide only what an unqualified route means.

**Why**: before, about fifty sites read `backend_type` with prefix predicates,
`split_once(':')` or string equality, and two host lookups disagreed. The TUI
attached a legacy `ssh:box` row through tmux while force-delete, the teardown
retry and the status poll ran `rmux` for the same row once the host's
preference changed. A lifecycle hook was told the host `box:rmux`. A mirrored
row lost the multiplexer its host recorded. A row stored as `tmux`, the
column's old default, had no backend at all. The registry rewrote an rmux or
herdr host to tmux, and a route's suffix rewrote the host's platform, so one row
naming `psmux` made a Linux host look like Windows.

**Rejected alternatives**:

- **Migrate the rows to qualified keys.** Irreversible, and a legacy key means
  something definite already. Reading it is enough.
- **Resolve an unqualified route against the host's current preference.** That
  is the bug: the preference can change after the row was written.
- **Allow `:` in host names and disambiguate against the registry.** The same
  key would then mean different things depending on which hosts load. The
  config load refuses such an entry instead.

**Consequences**: two spellings of one server (`ssh:box` and `ssh:box:tmux`,
or `tmux` and `local-tmux`) are compared through `session_ops::server_key`,
which qualifies both; per-backend state in the kernel is keyed the same way,
and a backend is named by the route it serves. Which multiplexer is available
is decided by registration, never by the OS. A route naming a multiplexer no
adapter implements is refused by name: such a row is neither created, attached,
torn down, polled, stopped nor restarted through the tmux command grammar,
and a teardown that cannot take its window leaves its worktrees too. A local
row on a multiplexer this machine does not run owes no teardown to come back
for, so its force-delete and reap refuse outright rather than mark it gone.
Local routes are qualified like remote ones (`local:<mux>`); the legacy
`local-tmux` keeps reading as the platform default, psmux on native Windows,
so an explicit tmux there is `local:tmux` and never mistaken for it. An older
build cannot attach a local row written as `local:<mux>`. A socket learned from a host's CLI is keyed
per host, because it names that host's talos instance, not one multiplexer.
Only what drives the multiplexer is told the row's multiplexer: the backend
`wiring` registers for the route, built with the host's own platform (ADR-13,
"The host's platform is its own dimension"). The headless status poll asks
that backend too (ADR-32).

## ADR-29: One backend registry per process; lifecycle goes through the row's backend

**Choice**: each composition root builds the `BackendRegistry` once through
`backend::wiring::configured` — `coordinator::boot` for the interface,
`bin/talos-cli`'s `main` for the CLI — and hands it down: to
`Terminals::with_registry`, to the command bus's workers, to the snapshot
store's create-flow reads, and as a parameter to `cli::run` and every
`session_ops` lifecycle entry point. Create, restart, stop, start, restore,
force delete, the reap sweep, the owed-teardown retry, rename and `session
register` ask it for the backend the row's route names
(`session_ops::windows::backend_for`) and act through the trait: `create_window`
opens a stamped, detached window; `locate` places a row's agent and shell
windows from one listing; `kill`, `pane_pid` and `stamp_window` work with or
without an attached connection; `rename_windows` follows a rename. A route no
backend is registered for is refused by every verb before anything is marked,
held, fired or written. Quit calls `shutdown_all`.

**Why**: the lifecycle verbs used to build a fresh `TmuxBackend` inside free
functions of the tmux adapter, so `session_ops` named the adapter and a second
backend could not own a session without editing it. Four other places rebuilt
the registry per call, so a consumer could see a different set of backends
from the one the process was wired with. And a route the registry did not
serve could still reach the local server: a restore of such a row marked it
restored and spawned on local tmux, and a `session start` cleared its stop mark
before refusing.

**Rejected alternatives**:

- **A headless method family beside the trait** (`*_headless`, or `(id,
  name)`-keyed copies of pane verbs): two vocabularies for one window. The
  headless verbs take an `Owner` or a pane, like the attached ones.
- **A cached global registry**: invisible to tests, and hidden state.
- **A test-only switch in the binary that loads a probe backend**: a
  production escape hatch. The routing tests run `cli::run` in-process with an
  in-memory backend registered for `local:rmux` and `ssh:<host>:rmux`, which
  also passes the contract suite `TmuxBackend` passes
  (`tests/support/backend_contract.rs`).
- **Silent defaults for the lifecycle methods**: `stamp_window`,
  `window_panes`, `set_pane_retention` and `shutdown` used to default to doing
  nothing, which let a stub compile and misbehave. Each backend now says what
  it does.

**Consequences**: RMUX and any future Herdr adapter own a session's lifecycle by
registering for its route in `wiring`; `session_ops` does not change. The
interface's registry is built from the `hosts.toml` of its start, so a host
added later is served once the interface restarts — the headless heartbeat
builds its own each tick. A host is served for the multiplexer its unqualified
rows mean (ADR-28), so a row written for tmux on a host whose entry later says
psmux is refused rather than driven — the two name different machines. Where
the interface holds a connection to a backend, a lifecycle kill goes through
it (reconnecting once on a dead link) rather than one-shot; either way it
kills the pane's whole window, so a window somebody split leaves nothing
running.
Pane I/O followed in ADR-30, and hook status and the heartbeat in ADR-32.

## ADR-30: Pane I/O is located by the row, then addressed by pane

**Choice**: every verb that types into, presses a key in, or reads a session's
pane — the kernel's `Send` and `dispatch_task`, `session send`/`key`/`capture`,
the `send` and `spawn` automations, `task run`, `session list --verify`/`get`,
`watch --verify`, `session doctor`'s `PATH` read and the interface's pane
probe — asks the injected registry for the backend the row's route names,
locates the row's agent window there (`session_ops::windows::agent_pane`:
`locate(Owner)`, stamp first, a lone unstamped namesake second), and then
calls a pane-keyed verb on the contract: `send_text`, `send_text_after`,
`send_key`, `capture`, `pane_state`, `pane_path`. A key crosses the contract as
`backend::Key`, talos's own closed set of spellings; the adapter says it in
its grammar (`session key` still reports that spelling as `tmux_key`).
Remote CLI pane verbs keep delegating to the host's own CLI first (ADR-24).

**Why**: the pane helpers were free functions of the tmux adapter that
resolved `(id, name)` on *this machine's* server whatever the row's route. A
row on a host was therefore typed into a local window of the same name that
no one had stamped — its prompt read as another session's input — and a row
on any other route was driven on local tmux or failed with "no window of its
own here" while the interface had its pane wired. A spawn automation that
found a lone `tb-auto-<id>` window typed into it by name even when no row
owned it.

**Rejected alternatives**:

- **`(id, name)`-keyed copies of the pane verbs on the trait**: a second
  addressing vocabulary beside the pane one every attached caller already
  holds. Locating is one step, done once, by the row.
- **Falling back to a name when the listing is ambiguous**: an `Unknown`
  placement is an error for every verb that writes to a pane, and a spawn
  that cannot tell whether its earlier session runs refuses rather than
  launching a second one; a reader (`--verify`, the doctor, the interface's
  probe) reports the state as unknown. The tmux adapter's own settling
  (retiring a duplicated stamp, psmux's unstamped windows reached by name,
  ADR-25) happens inside `locate`, where it is that backend's to decide.
- **Default methods**: the six verbs are required; a stub refuses them.

**Consequences**: a pane verb on a route nothing serves is refused by name
(`no backend here serves …`). A deferred prompt is scheduled on the pane's own
server, in the shell that server runs its commands with, so a spawn on a
host gets its prompt there. `pane_state` reads the foreground process's argv
with a local `ps` only for a local pane, and an answer that names another pane
than the one asked about — `display-message` answers for the current pane
against a target it cannot resolve — is no answer.

---

## ADR-31: tmux and psmux are peer adapters over one tmux-protocol server

**Choice**: `backend::tmux`, `backend::psmux`, and `backend::rmux` are peer adapters; none
names another. What all three speak — the tmux command grammar, control mode, the
session config, discovery, the headless spawn — is
`backend::tmux_compat::server::Server<M>`, generic over a `TmuxCompatible`
multiplexer `M`; each adapter is its multiplexer's answers to that trait: what
its server can do (`WINDOW_OPTIONS`, `WINDOW_EVENTS`, `SNAPSHOTS`, …), how it
quotes, how a window's command and environment reach it, how keystrokes and a
paste are typed (`PaneInput`), what its control-mode connection may expect
(`ControlPolicy`), and its version floor. The shared code asks what a server
can do and never which multiplexer it is. POSIX quoting, environment flags,
and window commands have shared trait defaults; adapters with a different
tokenizer or launch grammar override them. `ControlPolicy::flow_control_command`
provides an optional startup command to limit buffered output;
`PANE_MONITORING` gates
`refresh-client -A` when a server streams attached panes on its own, and
`COMMAND_LIST_SINGLE_REPLY` selects the number of reply blocks expected for
one semicolon-separated list. `backend::wiring` builds the
registry from one table, `(Multiplexer, AdapterFactory)`, where a factory is
`fn(&BackendSpec) -> Arc<dyn SessionBackend>` and a `BackendSpec` is the
route, the launcher, the platform and the host. Every adapter is registered
for this machine and for every host, whatever either's OS or preference; the
platform default (`Multiplexer::default_for`) and a host's preference decide
only what an unqualified route means and which backend is the default.

**Why**: psmux was one `TmuxBackend` with nineteen `uses_psmux()` branches —
a comparison of the binary's *name* — plus `cfg(windows)` sites in the local
spawn path that read the build OS as "the local multiplexer is psmux". So a
local tmux on Windows, or a local psmux anywhere else, could not exist, the
registry refused both by OS, and no rule could tell a psmux decision from a
tmux one because neither was visible as a reference. Status delivery (the
next step of the backend sequence) has to be owned by real, independent
adapters, and a third tmux-compatible multiplexer must be one module and one
table row.

**Rejected alternatives**:

- **Flags on one backend** (a `MuxDialect` of `const bool`s read by one
  `TmuxBackend`): keeps "psmux = tmux + an OS", and a quirk is still a branch
  in code the other multiplexer runs.
- **Duplicating the server in each adapter**: some three thousand lines that
  are the same protocol, which would drift.
- **Each adapter implementing `SessionBackend` by delegating to the shared
  server**: forty forwarding methods per adapter, saying nothing the trait
  does not; the multiplexer's own bodies are already the adapter's.
- **Registering a local adapter only on its "own" OS**: the gate this
  replaces. A binary that is not installed is reported, by name, when its
  backend is first asked to start (`preflight::Dependency::Multiplexer`).

**Consequences**: `tests/architecture_rules.rs` holds the shape by resolved
references: `the_adapters_are_peers` (no adapter reaches another, and
the helper reaches neither, test code included) and
`every_multiplexer_the_factory_serves_has_an_adapter_of_its_own` (each
adapter's code names exactly its own `Multiplexer` variant, no two the same,
and every one the factory names has one). `backend::wiring`'s selection matrix
registers probe adapters for all four multiplexers and checks each route
reaches its own from a POSIX and a Windows talos, locally, over ssh to a host
of either platform and in a WSL distro, built from the placement's platform
and launcher, with a launcher that adds nothing to the probe's command line.
The local picker offers every registered multiplexer whose optional binary is
available, so psmux appears on a POSIX machine and tmux on Windows. The
heartbeat, the own-pane status write
and the hook-state listing went behind the contract in ADR-32. The heartbeat
only ensures its session exists: every backend applies its config before it
spawns or attaches. psmux has not been driven live by this change.

RMUX extends this arrangement as a third adapter. Its control-mode policy
skips `pause-after`, pane monitoring, and format subscriptions, and treats a
command list as one reply, matching RMUX 0.10.0. Boundary markers split that
one reply into the three parts of a pane snapshot; detached resizes reserve one
reply too. RMUX polls pane liveness and remote hook options because its control
stream does not complete a killed pane's reader and refuses `refresh-client -B`.
Local creation, TUI attachment, and TUI-open pane deletion have been driven
live on Linux with RMUX 0.10.0; macOS, SSH, WSL, and native Windows remain
unverified. `Rmux::check_banner` rejects versions below 0.10.0; the server
reports a tmux compatibility version, so it cannot supply the RMUX floor.
The [0.10.0 release](https://github.com/Helvesec/rmux/releases/tag/v0.10.0)
changed the daemon wire protocol from 5 to 8 and rejects 0.9.x daemons.
See [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md#multiplexer-requirements-and-rmux-setup) for
installation, selection, and the verified version table.

## ADR-32: Hook status and the heartbeat are the route's backend's

**Choice**: how a hook in a session's pane reports its state, how that state is
read back with no interface attached, and what keeps the automation heartbeat
running are all verbs of `SessionBackend`, answered by the backend serving the
row's route:

- `hook_signal_command()` — the command a hook in this backend's panes runs, the
  state word appended, in place of `talos-cli session signal` where that CLI
  cannot reach this instance's database (a pane on a host). Spawn, restart and
  `agent launch-args` rewrite the shipped hook files and literal args to it;
  `None` means no channel, and then no hook config is shipped at all. A
  Windows host ships none either, whatever serves the row: an agent config
  path there is unproven, and that is the host's OS, not the backend's.
- `record_hook_state(pane, state)` — what `session signal` does after writing
  the row, on the row's own pane, so a peer attached to that backend sees it.
  Every agent hook runs `session signal`, so a local row's backend is found in
  a registry of this machine's backends alone (`wiring::local_only`) — no
  `hosts.toml`, no WSL distro discovery.
- `hook_states()` — every pane's state in one round trip, attached or not: what
  `automation tick` polls (`session_ops::remote_hooks::poll_hook_states`) for
  every route with live rows, local ones included.
- `take_hook_state_events()` — the live drain an attached interface already
  used.
- `ensure_heartbeat` / `heartbeat_running` / `stop_heartbeat` — the heartbeat
  is a request to the registry's default backend, and `runtime status` / `stop`
  ask the same one.

None has a default body. On a tmux-protocol server the channel is the
`@talos_state` pane option, its subscription and its poll — vocabulary that
moved out of `session` into `backend::tmux_compat::control_mode` — and each
adapter says whether it has one (`TmuxCompatible::HOOK_STATUS`): tmux does;
psmux does not until it is proven, which replaces the old
`session::psmux_hook_rewrite_supported` switch. The instance socket (ADR-12)
moved from `tmux_compat::socket` to `backend::instance`: it names the
instance's server, whichever multiplexer runs it.

**Why**: status was the last thing a consumer reached a concrete backend for.
`session_ops` built tmux and psmux command text itself, the headless poll ran
`tmux list-panes` on this machine's default server or ssh'd the host's binary,
`session signal` parsed `$TMUX`, and the heartbeat was a window on whatever
tmux was local. An RMUX or Herdr adapter — on either OS, with a channel that is
not a pane option at all — could not report status without editing `session`,
`session_ops` and `cli`, and a local server other than the default one was
never polled. Asking the route's backend makes each of those its own answer,
and grouping the poll by route means a pane id is matched only against the
backend that issued it: every server has a `%0`.

**Rejected**:

- *A default body returning "no status".* It compiles and goes dark: a new
  adapter would launch agents whose hooks report nowhere, with nothing saying
  so. Required, with `None`/`Err` as an explicit answer, is the same outcome
  said out loud.
- *Inferring the channel from the multiplexer's name or the host's OS.* That is
  what the psmux gate in `session` did; it is the adapter's fact.
- *Reading "no answer" as idle.* A backend that did not answer, has no channel,
  or serves no route here leaves the held state as it is.

**Consequences**: `tests/hook_status_routing.rs` registers in-memory backends
for `local:rmux`, `ssh:<h>:rmux` and stand-ins for a tmux and a psmux host,
each reporting a state for its own `%0`, and checks `automation tick` writes
each to its own row with no tmux window made and no host asked; `session
signal` reaches the row's backend; and the heartbeat and `runtime` reach the
local one. The contract suite holds tmux and the fake to the same status and
heartbeat behaviour. `consumers_reach_no_concrete_backend` checks that
`session_ops`, `cli` and `kernel` reference no adapter, protocol helper or
factory — through aliases and re-exports, test code included — and that no
grant, followed transitively, would let them; `TRANSITIONAL` is empty. `agent`
is now governed file by file, so a consumer names the agent config it reads.
`scripts/dev/e2e/windows-vm.sh` reads the psmux gate from `talos-cli runtime
status --json` (`hook_status`) instead of grepping the source. psmux status
over a live Windows host is still unproven, and stays off.

## ADR-33: A running interface owns its local control endpoint

**Choice**: each TUI has a random instance ID and a local socket or named pipe,
separate from the session backend. Discovery is scoped to the data profile and
probes each endpoint before offering it as a target. With several reachable
interfaces, a caller must select an ID. The transport worker bounds request
size, clients, queue depth and wait time, then hands typed requests to the
coordinator. Only the coordinator reads UI state or invokes Lua, and it replies
after applying or refusing the request.
An endpoint failure leaves the interface running with a startup notice; startup
notices appear in turn on their own timer so other status messages cannot hide
later warnings. An active error keeps its full display interval before the next
startup notice appears.
Discovery prunes records confirmed dead, keeping repeated scans bounded
by currently reachable interfaces and the records left since the last scan.

**Why**: several interfaces can display the same database while each owns its
own focus and search state. The older `session focus` metadata slot is claimed
by one unspecified interface and cannot acknowledge which screen changed.
Routing through a backend would confuse a session's persistent terminal with
the ephemeral interface drawing it.

**First slice**: `session.focus` checks the target's snapshot and selects the
session there; `search.open` sets a query through the loaded search plugin and
is idempotent. `ui state` reports focus, selection and query. Lua action handlers
may receive a read-only typed argument table as a second parameter; existing
one-parameter handlers continue to work. The runtime action catalog combines
kernel shortcuts with loaded plugin bindings and commands. The same descriptors
drive the palette, `ui actions`, and `schema`; local action requests validate
arguments and availability before invoking the owner. Addressed `ui input`
handles active modal and plugin text, keys and scroll without forwarding terminal
bytes. Destructive external actions receive one-use, instance-bound tickets;
the second request revalidates the target and records an owner-only audit
decision before dispatch. The receipt and action event report acceptance;
the worker's command status reports its eventual outcome. Menu choices pass
their row target as a typed argument to the owning
action. No visible terminal capture is part of this API.
