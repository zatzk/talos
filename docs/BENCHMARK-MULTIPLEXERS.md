# Benchmark: raw tmux vs Herdr vs talos

How the three compare as the thing your coding agents live in: starting
sessions, holding them, showing them, typing into them, and surviving a crash.
Same stand-in agent everywhere, so what differs is the host.

Re-run it in one command, from a checkout of the commit you want to measure:

```sh
nix develop -c just bench-multiplexers                    # everything
nix develop -c just bench-multiplexers --quick --reps 1   # try the harness
```

Measured 2026-09-23 on a dedicated, otherwise idle 4-core machine (details
under [The machine](#the-machine)): **tmux 3.7c**, **Herdr 0.9.1** (release
binary), **talos** built in release from `main` at `0a7c8ece`. Every number
is a median over 5 repetitions with the worst of them (p95) in brackets, unless
it says otherwise. Raw samples: [`benchmark-multiplexers/`](benchmark-multiplexers/).

## The short version

| | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|
| keystroke to echo, idle | **1.0 ms** | 2.2 ms | 25 ms (p95 48) |
| create 50 sessions | **0.46 s** | 2.6 s | 4.6 s |
| host memory, 50 sessions, nothing attached | **4.2 MiB** | 41 MiB | 9.2 MiB |
| host CPU, 50 idle sessions, nothing attached | **0 %** | 22.5 % | **0 %** |
| host CPU, 50 idle sessions, client attached | **0 %** | 76 % | 10 % |
| host memory, 50 sessions, client attached | **13 MiB** | 54 MiB | 81 MiB |
| sessions running their command again after a restart | 0 of 3 | 0 of 3 (layout back) | **3 of 3** |

Where the three put the terminal, which explains most of the table:

```text
tmux       agent ─pty─ tmux server (parses, keeps the screen) ── tmux client ── your terminal
Herdr      agent ─pty─ herdr server (parses: libghostty-vt)   ── herdr client ── your terminal
talos    agent ─pty─ tmux server (parses, keeps the screen) ── control mode ── talos (parses
                                                                                  again: vt100,
                                                                                  draws: ratatui)
```

talos with nothing attached **is** tmux, plus an idle placeholder shell and
the automation heartbeat loop, so headless it costs what tmux costs. Attached,
it is a full-screen application on top, and — until
[lazy session parsing](#revisited-a-session-nobody-is-looking-at-keeps-no-grid-2026-09-23)
— a second terminal emulator per session, which is where it paid most.

**Where talos loses, plainly:**

- **Typing feels slower.** A keystroke came back in 25 ms (p95 48 ms), and
  42 ms whenever another session was busy — against 1–2 ms for tmux and Herdr.
  The samples clustered rather than spread: the echo arrives as agent output,
  so it waited out the 33 ms output floor (ADR-P17). Now 4.2 ms idle and 1.9 ms
  busy ([revisited](#revisited-a-keystrokes-echo-and-session-creation-2026-09-24)): no longer paced, but still behind Herdr's 2.1 and
  tmux's 1.0 when the machine is quiet.
- **Creating sessions was the slowest of the three**: 92 ms a session against
  Herdr's ~50 and tmux's 8, so 50 sessions took 4.6 s. Every `session create`
  ran 27 processes, 20 of them separate `tmux set-option` calls re-applying
  the same server options
  ([#1243](https://github.com/zatzk/talos/issues/1243)). Now six
  processes, 36 ms a session and 1.8 s for 50 — faster than Herdr, still
  behind tmux ([revisited](#revisited-a-keystrokes-echo-and-session-creation-2026-09-24)).
- **Attached, it was the heaviest on memory** (29 MiB with one session, 81 MiB
  with 50, about 1 MiB a session) and it is never quite idle (2.8 % of a core
  with one session, 10 % with 50, where tmux is at 0). The memory half is
  answered below: a session off screen no longer keeps a terminal grid, which
  puts 50 attached sessions at about half their old cost and under Herdr's
  ([revisited](#revisited-a-session-nobody-is-looking-at-keeps-no-grid-2026-09-23)).
- **Its first view of a busy session can be stale.** After a headless session
  had printed ~100 lines, the interface's first frame of it lacked the latest
  lines — every repetition, every N, and never on tmux or Herdr — until the
  agent printed again. A correctness bug, not a cost
  ([#1242](https://github.com/zatzk/talos/issues/1242)). Gone since a
  session's grid is rebuilt from a snapshot taken in step with its output
  ([revisited](#revisited-a-session-nobody-is-looking-at-keeps-no-grid-2026-09-23)).
- **Reading history through the CLI** takes 47 ms against 6–8, most of it
  starting `talos-cli`.
- **Attaching** takes 170–240 ms against tmux's 11 (90–180 ms since the
  interface's own session setup became one tmux call,
  [revisited](#revisited-a-keystrokes-echo-and-session-creation-2026-09-24)).

**Where talos wins:** it is the only one of the three that brings the
sessions' commands back after a shutdown (in 0.22 s); with nothing attached it
costs no CPU at all at any N, where Herdr's server burns 9 % of a core at 20
idle sessions and 22.5 % at 50; and attached with many sessions it is far
cheaper than Herdr (10 % against 76 % idle, 39 % against 90 % under output).

**Where Herdr wins:** latency (2.2 ms idle, and 0.45 ms while another session
is busy), draining a burst (127 ms against 215), and scrollback held (5 500
lines of the burst against 2 000–2 500). Its costs grow with the session count,
even at rest.

## Results by scenario

### Create N sessions

From nothing running, one after another. N=1 includes starting the host.

| N | metric | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | first agent running (cold start) | 38 (38) ms | 147 (148) ms | 88 (92) ms |
| 5 | all agents running | 64 (74) ms | 197 (308) ms | 457 (569) ms |
| 20 | all agents running | 196 (200) ms | 1.03 (1.15) s | 1.90 (1.99) s |
| 50 | all agents running | 460 (470) ms | 2.58 (3.09) s | 4.58 (5.20) s |
| 50 | one create command, mean | 8.6 (8.7) ms | 51 (61) ms | 92 (104) ms |
| 50 | the 50th create command | 8.0 (13) ms | 28 (117) ms | 92 (92) ms |

For a user: a script that fans out 50 agents waits 4.6 s for talos before
the agents even start loading. None of the three slows down much as sessions
pile up — talos's cost is flat per session, and flat high. Herdr's first
session includes starting its server.

### Attach, detach, reattach

| N | metric | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | attach | 11 (16) ms | 68 (69) ms | 168 (179) ms |
| 20 | attach | 12 (12) ms | 289 (306) ms | 185 (193) ms |
| 50 | attach | 13 (14) ms | 435 (446) ms | 242 (254) ms |
| 1 | detach | 2.7 (2.7) ms | 11 (12) ms | 12 (13) ms |
| 50 | detach | 7.0 (7.1) ms | 11 (21) ms | 24 (26) ms |
| 1 | reattach | 10 (11) ms | 182 (183) ms | 177 (187) ms |
| 50 | reattach | 9.1 (9.1) ms | 411 (430) ms | 431 (592) ms |

All sessions survived every detach on all three. For a user: tmux is instant;
talos and Herdr both take a noticeable fraction of a second with many
sessions, Herdr growing faster with N. talos's detach is its Quit (Ctrl+Q) —
the interface exits and tmux keeps the sessions.

### Memory and CPU

The host's processes only (see *Accounting*). "Output" is every session
printing 10 lines a second; attached, the client shows session 1.

| N | state | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | headless, idle | 3.7 MiB · 0 % | 17.7 MiB · 0.6 % | 8.3 MiB · 0 % |
| 1 | attached, idle | 6.2 MiB · 0 % | 22.6 MiB · 1.0 % | 28.6 MiB · 2.8 % |
| 1 | attached, output | 6.2 MiB · 0.3 % | 22.6 MiB · 8.7 % | 28.6 MiB · 8.1 % |
| 20 | headless, idle | 3.9 MiB · 0 % | 26.8 MiB · 9.0 % | 8.7 MiB · 0 % |
| 20 | headless, output | 4.0 MiB · 3.9 % | 27.2 MiB · 21 % | 8.7 MiB · 4.3 % |
| 20 | attached, idle | 8.7 MiB · 0 % | 34.8 MiB · 18.7 % | 49.1 MiB · 5.3 % |
| 20 | attached, output | 8.7 MiB · 4.0 % | 34.9 MiB · 33.7 % | 49.3 MiB · 19.8 % |
| 50 | headless, idle | 4.2 MiB · 0 % | 41.1 MiB · 22.5 % | 9.2 MiB · 0 % |
| 50 | headless, output | 4.6 MiB · 7.2 % | 41.9 MiB · 70 % | 9.4 MiB · 8.7 % |
| 50 | attached, idle | 12.7 MiB · 0 % | 53.8 MiB · 76 % | 80.5 MiB · 10.1 % |
| 50 | attached, output | 12.7 MiB · 6.2 % | 53.9 MiB · 90 % | 82.6 MiB · 38.7 % |

Memory is PSS; CPU is a percentage of one core over 10 s. A 65 s window at
N=20, headless and idle, to catch periodic work: tmux 0 %, Herdr 9.0 %,
talos 0 %. That window cannot see a process that starts and exits inside it,
so talos's once-a-minute `talos-cli automation tick` was timed on its own:
about 0.02 s of CPU a run, 0.03 % of a core.
The p95s are within 1 % of the medians except Herdr at N=50 (up to 106 %
attached under output) and talos's attached memory at N=50 (up to 91 MiB).

For a user: if agents sit in the background, talos costs what tmux costs and
Herdr costs a real slice of a core that grows with every session, even when
nothing is happening. Attached, talos is the heaviest on memory and sits
between the other two on CPU.

### Throughput: a 50 000-line burst

One session prints 50 000 lines of about 107 bytes (5.4 MB) as fast as its pty
takes them.

| | metric | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| headless | agent's writes took | 215 (218) ms | 127 (131) ms | 215 (221) ms |
| headless | until the host went quiet | 343 (352) ms | 263 (1262) ms | 353 (355) ms |
| headless | host CPU spent | 0.21 (0.22) s | 0.14 (0.16) s | 0.21 (0.23) s |
| attached | agent's writes took | 233 (234) ms | 143 (143) ms | 246 (248) ms |
| attached | last line on the client's screen | 333 (337) ms | 158 (159) ms | 260 (263) ms |
| attached | until the host went quiet | 447 (449) ms | 790 (1036) ms | 442 (585) ms |
| attached | host CPU spent | 0.23 (0.23) s | 0.20 (0.20) s | 0.38 (0.41) s |
| attached | host memory after | 8.4 MiB | 23.2 MiB | 36.5 MiB |

Nothing was dropped at the tail: on every host and every repetition, the last
rows the host reported (up to 120) were the last lines written, in order.
Earlier lines were not checked; each host's history limit has let most of them
go anyway (see scrollback). For a user: a log-dumping
agent is never slowed by any of the three; Herdr drains fastest, and talos
shows the end of a burst sooner than `tmux attach` does, at about 1.6 times
the CPU.

### Scrollback

After one 50 000-line burst, headless.

| metric | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|
| lines of it the host keeps | 2 001 | ~5 500 | 2 500 |
| lines one CLI read returns | 2 001 | 998 | 2 500 |
| host memory the history costs | 2.1 MiB | 7.0 MiB | 1.7 MiB |
| reading all of it through the CLI | 7.8 (9.2) ms | 6.3 (6.3) ms | 47 (50) ms |

Each keeps what its default allows: tmux 2 000 lines; talos 5 000 rows, which
is 2 500 of these lines in its 80-column headless window; Herdr 10 MB, about
5 500 rows. Herdr's `pane read` returns at most 1 000 lines however many are
asked for, so a script sees less than it holds (the ~5 500 is from its own
scroll metrics). For a user: none of them keeps a long build log by default;
talos's CLI is the slowest to hand it over.

### Keystroke to echo

Through the attached client, 500 keys per cell (5 repetitions of 100), sent
60–100 ms apart at random, send to send, so every host gets the same typing
rate.

| | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|
| idle, median (p95) | 1.03 (1.09) ms | 2.19 (2.34) ms | 25.4 (48.5) ms |
| another session busy, median (p95) | 0.74 (0.98) ms | 0.44 (0.52) ms | 42.2 (43.1) ms |

No key was lost on any host. talos's samples are not spread but clustered:
idle at about 4, 13, 24 and 47 ms; with another session busy at about 11, 21
and 42 ms. For a user: 1–2 ms is imperceptible; 25–48 ms is the difference between
a local shell and a slightly laggy remote one, and it is there on every key.
Herdr getting faster while another session is busy was not investigated.

### Survival

Three sessions.

| event | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|
| client SIGKILLed: agents still running | 3 of 3 | 3 of 3 | 3 of 3 |
| server SIGKILLed: agents still running | 0 of 3 | 0 of 3 | 0 of 3 |
| shutdown (all SIGTERMed), host started again: sessions it lists | 0 | 3 | 3 |
| … sessions running their command again | 0 | 0 | 3, in 222 (270) ms |

For talos the server is its tmux server; killing the talos interface is
the client row, and loses nothing. After the restart,
Herdr restores its layout and would resume the agents it supports (Claude
Code, Codex and others) — the stand-in is not one, so its panes come back as
shells. talos re-runs the recorded command of every session it has a row
for, whatever the command is. For a user: after a reboot, talos puts your
sessions back; Herdr puts back the ones running an agent it knows; tmux puts
back nothing.

## What this points at in talos

Recorded, not fixed here — the benchmark does not tune what it measures. Each
can be re-measured with the scenario named; the two revisits below say what
has been done since.

1. **Echo latency** (`latency`): a keystroke's echo is agent output, so it is
   drawn on the 33 ms output floor. Output from the session that just received
   a key, arriving within a frame or two of it, is arguably input and could
   take the 16 ms floor — or no floor. Now no floor, and a frame that redraws
   only that pane: 4.2 ms idle ([revisited](#revisited-a-keystrokes-echo-and-session-creation-2026-09-24)).
2. **Stale first view on attach** (`resources`, `first_view_stale`),
   [#1242](https://github.com/zatzk/talos/issues/1242): no longer
   reproduced by the harness at any N — see the revisit below. The adopt path
   it came from (a capture taken by a second tmux client, raced by the output
   already in flight) is now used only with `hidden_terminal_secs = 0`.
3. **`session create` cost** (`create`),
   [#1243](https://github.com/zatzk/talos/issues/1243): 20
   `tmux set-option` processes per create re-apply options the server already
   has. One `tmux` invocation, or
   once per server, would remove most of the 92 ms. Now one invocation: 36 ms
   ([revisited](#revisited-a-keystrokes-echo-and-session-creation-2026-09-24)).
4. **Attached memory and idle CPU per session** (`resources`): ~1 MiB and ~0.15 %
   of a core per session with the interface up and nothing happening. The
   memory is answered (below); what is left per session is the reader thread
   each pane gets, ~0.1–0.2 MiB. The CPU is not.
5. **`session capture` start-up** (`scrollback`): 47 ms to hand back 2 500
   lines, against 8 for `tmux capture-pane`.

## Revisited: a session nobody is looking at keeps no grid (2026-09-23)

The question: *can the interface lazily parse sessions that are not on
screen?* The answer is yes, and the design and its reasons are ADR-P27 in
[PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md#adr-p27-a-session-nobody-is-looking-at-keeps-no-grid-2026-09-23).
In short: a session off screen for `hidden_terminal_secs` (default 30), or never
shown, keeps a two-cell parser that still reads its output for the title,
bells, notifications and the "printing" stamp; showing or searching it rebuilds
its grid from a tmux snapshot that travels in the pane's own control-mode
stream, so the rebuild lands at exactly the byte it describes.

**Where the megabyte went.** Before changing anything, the interface process
alone at N=50 attached, 200x50, measured with the same harness pieces:

| `scrollback_lines` | nothing scrolled (the benchmark's state) | every history full |
|---|---|---|
| 100 | 42.5 MiB | 74 MiB |
| 1,000 (default) | 42.5 MiB | 350 MiB |
| 5,000 | 42.7 MiB | 1,576 MiB |

So the benchmark's "about 1 MiB a session" was the screen grid of each session
(200x50 cells at 32 bytes, sized to the whole terminal) plus a little seeded
history; a session whose history has filled costs 6.3 KiB more per history
row, ~6 MiB at the default. Lowering `scrollback_lines` would move only the
right-hand column, and take history from the session on screen too.

**Before and after**, `resources` and `latency` with all three hosts, 5
repetitions after a warm-up, on a second, otherwise idle machine of the same
model (4-core i5-6500T, `powersave`, 15.5 GiB) running Debian 13 and tmux 3.5a
— so these columns compare with each other and not with the tables above.
*Before* is `main` at `e6971b29`, *after* is this change at `e4f0549b`; the
commit after it touches only the search's read path. Raw samples:
[`benchmark-multiplexers/lazy-parse/`](benchmark-multiplexers/lazy-parse/).

| N | state | talos before | talos after | Herdr (before run / after run) | tmux |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | headless, idle | 5.9 MiB · 0 % | 6.0 MiB · 0 % | 19.7 / 19.7 MiB | 5.2 MiB |
| 1 | attached, idle | 28.8 MiB · 3.0 % | 29.0 MiB · 3.1 % | 28.3 / 26.6 MiB | 10.7 MiB |
| 20 | headless, idle | 5.8 MiB · 0 % | 6.0 MiB · 0 % | 28.6 / 28.6 MiB | 5.1 MiB |
| 20 | attached, idle | 49.0 MiB · 6.0 % | **36.5 MiB** · 6.2 % | 38.7 / 40.7 MiB | 13.2 MiB |
| 20 | attached, output | 49.3 MiB · 20.5 % | **36.5 MiB** · 20.8 % | 38.7 / 46.7 MiB | 13.2 MiB |
| 50 | headless, idle | 5.8 MiB · 0 % | 5.9 MiB · 0 % | 42.5 / 45.9 MiB | 5.2 MiB |
| 50 | attached, idle | 104 (221) MiB · 11.2 % | **48.3 (87.4) MiB** · 11.5 % | 57.4 / 72.6 MiB | 16.0 MiB |
| 50 | attached, output | 80.3 (128) MiB · 39.7 % | **46.9 (49.0) MiB** · 38.7 % | 57.6 / 80.5 MiB | 16.2 MiB |

Memory is PSS median (worst of 5 in brackets where it differs by more than
10 %), CPU a percentage of one core, as above. At N=50 attached talos now
holds less than Herdr in either run on this machine, and less than the 53.8 MiB
Herdr measured on the first. The worst idle sample after (87 MiB) is a
transient right after attaching: the same repetition read 49 MiB ten seconds
later. Before, those transients were the norm (80–221 MiB across repetitions).
Headless nothing changed, and nothing should: headless there is no interface.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| keystroke to echo, idle, median (p95) | 23.9 (48.0) ms | 24.8 (48.2) ms |
| … another session busy | 42.2 (43.0) ms | 42.1 (43.0) ms |
| first view of session 1 stale (`first_view_stale`), N = 1, 20, 50 | every repetition | none |

Latency and CPU are unchanged within the spread; the echo is still paced by
the output floor, which is the other half of the list below.

**What it costs**, measured with a release build on 20 sessions of 1,000
history rows at 200x50 (ADR-P27 has the method):

- Showing a session whose grid was dropped takes 9–11 ms to draw instead of
  under 1 ms: a control-mode round trip and a parse. Over a slow link the
  paint waits at most 100 ms, then draws the pane blank and fills it when the
  snapshot lands.
- A search opened cold reads each such session back from tmux: ~56 ms for all
  20 instead of ~35. A keystroke after that is no slower (~6 ms against ~11).
- `hidden_terminal_secs = 0` keeps every grid, and is exactly the old
  behaviour. psmux (Windows) cannot hand a pane back in step with its output,
  so sessions there keep their grids either way.

## Revisited: a keystroke's echo, and session creation (2026-09-24)

The two costs a user feels most — typing latency and creating sessions — worked
on, and measured the way everything above was: two complete runs of every
scenario, one after the other, on the machine of the first table (the 4-core
i5-6500T, NixOS, tmux 3.7c). *Before* is `main` at `171f4a10`, which already
has lazy session parsing; *after* adds this work at `1a6b60c0`. tmux's and
Herdr's columns are from the *after* run and agree with the *before* run's
within the spread. 1-minute load: 0.84 when the *before* run started (a
launch of the same run killed seconds earlier), 0.22 when it ended; 0.11 and
0.08 for *after*. Raw samples:
[`benchmark-multiplexers/echo-and-create/`](benchmark-multiplexers/echo-and-create/).

| | tmux | Herdr | talos before | talos after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| keystroke to echo, idle | 0.97 (1.05) ms | 2.06 (2.20) ms | 24.7 (48.3) ms | **3.37 (4.66) ms** |
| … another session busy | 0.74 (0.98) ms | 0.45 (0.57) ms | 42.1 (43.2) ms | **1.65 (2.48) ms** |
| create 50 sessions | 454 (467) ms | 2.66 (2.80) s | 4.74 (5.02) s | **1.81 (1.84) s** |
| one create command, mean, N=50 | 8.5 (8.7) ms | 52 (55) ms | 95 (101) ms | **36 (37) ms** |
| create 20 sessions | 200 (203) ms | 1.09 (1.18) s | 1.95 (2.63) s | **730 (776) ms** |
| first agent running (cold) | 38 (38) ms | 149 (149) ms | 94 (104) ms | **80 (88) ms** |
| attach, N=1 / N=50 | 11 / 13 ms | 243 / 433 ms | 162 / 210 ms | **88 / 178 ms** |

Latency is median (p95) of 500 keys; the rest median (worst of 5). Three
code commits came after the *after* build: counters for the tests, a narrower
wake-up (only the pane that owes an echo wakes the loop), and a queue that
keeps every wait when one input batch contains several keys. The latency
scenario alone, re-run after the rebase on the final code head (`60c81b6c`),
measured 4.18 (5.38) ms idle and 1.88 (3.36) ms busy, against Herdr's 2.14
(2.32) and 0.45 (0.55) in the same run; neither lost a key. Load was 1.46 at
the start and 1.92 at the end, with measured samples spanning 0.41–2.01
([`echo-and-create/head/`](benchmark-multiplexers/echo-and-create/head/)).

A second latency-only run on the same code (`60c81b6c`), from an otherwise idle
machine on 2026-09-25, confirmed the remaining gap. The 1-minute load was 0.08
at the start and 1.52 at the end; the 36 host/variant repetitions started at
0.02–1.50 and ended at 0.02–1.52 as the harness itself ran. All three used the
same defaults and 100 keys per repetition; no key timed out. These are medians
(p95) of 500 measured keys per host and variant, after one warm-up repetition.
The complete raw results are in
[`echo-and-create/quiet-head/`](benchmark-multiplexers/echo-and-create/quiet-head/).

| keystroke to echo | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| idle | 1.04 (1.10) ms | 2.21 (2.35) ms | **4.14 (5.15) ms** |
| another session busy | 0.76 (0.96) ms | 0.45 (0.55) ms | **1.91 (3.15) ms** |

The final source commit (`78ca3f93`) was measured again on that machine with
the same defaults, one warm-up and five measured repetitions for each host and
variant. The release build was already complete and the machine's 1-minute load
was 0.17 at the start and 0.74 at the end; measured repetitions began at
0.06–1.15. This run covered both 100-key latency and 50,000-line throughput.
The complete samples, including per-repetition load, are in
[`echo-and-create/current-latency-throughput/`](benchmark-multiplexers/echo-and-create/current-latency-throughput/).
The latency figures are median (p95) of 500 measured keys per host and
variant; no key timed out.

| exact-source-head keystroke to echo | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| idle | 1.04 (1.10) ms | 2.23 (2.34) ms | **4.13 (5.56) ms** |
| another session busy | 0.76 (0.95) ms | 0.45 (0.55) ms | **1.90 (2.90) ms** |

The same run measured the burst's time to appear at the attached client,
host CPU spent on the burst, and PSS after it. Every checked output tail was
intact. Values below are medians of five measured repetitions. The visible
time is not available when headless, so the headless row gives the time for
output to settle instead.

| 50,000-line burst | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| attached visible, ms | 334 | 158 | **269** |
| attached host CPU, s | 0.23 | 0.19 | **0.38** |
| attached PSS after, MiB | 7.73 | 23.2 | **37.1** |
| headless settle, ms | 338 | 255 | **343** |
| headless host CPU, s | 0.21 | 0.13 | **0.21** |
| headless PSS after, MiB | 5.21 | 25.3 | **9.95** |

The resource scenario was also rerun on the final source commit (`78ca3f93`)
on the same 4-core machine. It used the same N=1, 20 and 50 states and
10-second CPU windows, with one warm-up and five measured repetitions; only
the separate 65-second N=20 idle-long probe was skipped. The release build
ended just before timing, so 1-minute load began at 1.40 and ended at 2.51.
At N=50, four measured repetitions began at load 0.24–0.38 and the last began
at 5.48 after the preceding 50-session teardown. Timed commands ran at
niceness zero with no other benchmark running. Raw samples and per-repetition
load are in
[`echo-and-create/current-resources/`](benchmark-multiplexers/echo-and-create/current-resources/).

| N=50 state | CPU, % of one core, median (p95) | PSS, MiB, median (p95) |
|---|---:|---:|
| attached idle | 9.45 (9.48) | **46.9 (56.7)** |
| attached output | 35.3 (38.1) | 47.2 (47.2) |
| headless idle | 0 (0) | 9.06 (9.06) |
| headless output | 8.90 (9.40) | 9.33 (9.33) |

The five attached idle PSS samples were 46.7, 56.7, 46.9, 46.9 and 46.8 MiB.
The 56.7 MiB spike occurred in a repetition that began at load 0.24; ten
seconds later its attached output reading was 47.1 MiB. The full earlier
after run's 52.3 MiB median remains a real result, and the current head still
shows a brief high-water mark. This run does not establish a cause for it.

No simple wait remains to remove from the idle path: the earlier trace below
puts roughly 1.4 ms in painting and flushing a pane, 1.1 ms in tmux control
mode and thread hand-offs, and 0.5 ms in the focused plugin's key handler. A
change large enough to beat Herdr's 2.21 ms idle median would have to cut into
those costs while retaining plugin key handling, output ordering and the
bounded output rate. This run supplies no evidence for claiming an idle win.

**Typing.** The echo of a key is agent output, and was painted on the 33 ms
output floor measured from the frame the keystroke itself had just painted,
then noticed only at the next 10 ms input-poll tick, since nothing woke the loop
when output landed. Now a key sent to a terminal owes an echo: the loop sleeps
on the terminal *and* on a pipe that pane's output reader pokes, holds the key's own
frame for it, and paints it at once by redrawing only that pane over the last
frame
([ADR-P28](PERFORMANCE.md#adr-p28-a-keystrokes-echo-is-painted-at-once-2026-09-23)).
It is still slower than Herdr and tmux when nothing else is happening. A trace
of one key from the earlier 3.4 ms run puts ~1.4 ms in re-rendering the pane and
flushing the frame, ~1.1 ms through tmux's control mode and the threads between
it and the screen (each waking a core from idle), and ~0.5 ms offering the key
to the focused pane's Lua before it goes out; ADR-P28 says what removing each
would cost. With another session printing, cores stay awake and it is 1.9 ms —
under Herdr's idle figure, above its busy one.

**Creating.** A `session create` ran 27 processes, 20 of them `tmux set-option`
re-applying the same options twice. The options are now one tmux command list,
sent in the same process as the `has-session` that precedes it, and the window's
identity is stamped in `new-window`'s own command list: six processes. Attaching
and restarting got faster for the same reason — the interface runs the same
setup when it starts. What is left of the 36 ms is mostly starting `talos-cli`.

**CPU, memory and throughput from the full before/after run.** These are
medians of five measured repetitions at N=50, with the same 10-second CPU
window and PSS accounting for every host. The after run's attached idle PSS
**rose from 46.0 to 52.3 MiB**. Its CPU stayed near 10 % of one core; headless
idle CPU stayed at zero and headless PSS stayed under 9 MiB, well below
Herdr's 41.1 MiB. Neither CPU nor memory is an overall win across the rows.

| N=50 state and metric | tmux after | Herdr after | talos before | talos after |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| attached idle CPU, % of one core | 0 | 86.7 | 9.89 | 9.67 |
| attached idle PSS, MiB | 12.1 | 53.8 | 46.0 | **52.3** |
| attached output CPU, % of one core | 5.87 | 104 | 35.9 | 36.0 |
| attached output PSS, MiB | 12.1 | 53.9 | 46.6 | 46.7 |
| headless idle CPU, % of one core | 0 | 22.5 | 0 | 0 |
| headless idle PSS, MiB | 3.55 | 41.1 | 8.70 | 8.84 |
| headless output CPU, % of one core | 7.40 | 93.1 | 8.00 | 8.70 |
| headless output PSS, MiB | 3.99 | 41.9 | 8.97 | 9.10 |

The attached idle PSS increase was uneven: three of five after samples were
above 52 MiB, while the output window measured ten seconds later was 46.7–46.9
MiB. Four more rounds of the idle row alone, alternating builds (20 repetitions
each), put both medians at 46 MiB; the new build exceeded 47 MiB five times,
up to 55, and the old build once, at 47.6. The new build showed more brief
post-attach spikes. An earlier opening of the measurement window is possible
because attach got faster, but the cause was not proven. The echo path keeps a
copy of the screen (~0.4 MiB at 200x50) only while someone types, so none of it
is kept at rest. Headless PSS rose by 0.14 MiB at N=50.

The 50,000-line attached burst took 259 → 260 ms to reach the screen, used
0.39 → 0.37 s of host CPU and finished with 36.0 → 36.8 MiB PSS. Every run's
checked output tail was intact. Herdr reached the screen in 158 ms in the after
run, and tmux in 334 ms; neither number says how much CPU or memory that
latency cost.

## What was measured, and why these

The question is "which host costs me what, for the work every one of them
does". So each scenario is something all three do, done the way each one's own
documentation says to do it headlessly, and nothing that is one host's special
trick:

| scenario | what it does | tmux | Herdr | talos |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| create | N sessions from cold, one after another | `new-session` / `new-window` | `workspace create` / `tab create`, then `pane run` | `talos-cli session create --command` |
| attach | client on a pty; leave; come back | `tmux attach` | `herdr` | `talos` |
| resources | memory and CPU at rest and under output, headless and attached | | | |
| throughput | one session prints 50 000 lines as fast as it can | | | |
| scrollback | what the host keeps of that, and reading it back through its CLI | `capture-pane` | `pane read` | `session capture` |
| latency | keystroke to echo, through the attached client | | | |
| survival | client killed, server killed, a shutdown and restart | | | |

Left out, on purpose:

- **Herdr's agent detection and talos's plugin panes and hook-driven
  status.** Each is a feature only one of them has. Their running cost is
  inside the totals — Herdr's detection runs in its server, talos's panes
  are its client — because a user cannot switch them off either, but neither
  is measured as a feature against the others.
- **Remote hosts (SSH).** All three can do it, and all three differently;
  it is a benchmark of its own.
- **A real coding agent.** Claude Code or Codex would make the numbers about
  the agent: its startup, its redraw rate, its memory. The stand-in is the
  constant.

## Method

**The stand-in agent** (`scripts/bench/agent.py`) is one Python process per
session, identical on every host. It writes the monotonic time it started to
a file, then waits. Every byte typed at it is answered with a four-letter token
redrawn in place; a signal makes it print a burst of 50 000 lines of ~107 bytes,
another starts or stops a trickle of 10 lines a second. Signals rather than
typed commands, so starting a burst does not go through the input path being
measured. Readiness and burst timing come from the agent's own clock, never
from polling a host.

**Hermetic.** Every repetition gets a fresh sandbox: its own `HOME`, XDG
directories, runtime dir and `TMUX_TMPDIR`, its own tmux socket (tmux with
`-f /dev/null`), its own Herdr named session and state, and talos relocated
with `TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` / `TALOS_DATA_DIR` / `TALOS_SOCKET` exactly as
`scripts/dev/sandbox.sh` does. Every server started is killed before the next
repetition, and the sandbox deleted.

**Defaults, except where the network or a first-run question is concerned.**
Every host runs its own defaults. Changed, and why:

| host | setting | why |
|---|---|---|
| tmux | `-f /dev/null` | the machine's `~/.tmux.conf` is not tmux |
| Herdr | `onboarding = false` | what finishing the first-run welcome writes; a returning user never sees it |
| Herdr | `[update] version_check = false`, `manifest_check = false` | no network |
| Herdr | `[server] headless_cols/rows = 200x50` | the size tmux sessions are created at, so both parse the same grid |
| talos | `[features] version_check = false`, `auto_update = false` | no network |
| talos | `talos-cli config accept-interface` | the one-time "this is v2" question; a returning user never sees it |

talos's headless windows stay at its own 80x24: sizing them is not a knob it
offers, and the benchmark does not tune talos.

**Accounting.** "The host" is every process in the host's trees except the
agents, which report their own pids: the server, anything it keeps running
beside the sessions (talos's placeholder shell and automation heartbeat
loop), and an attached client with whatever it spawned (talos's tmux
control-mode client). Memory is PSS from `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup`, so a
library shared between two host processes is counted once. CPU is
`utime + stime` from `/proc/<pid>/stat` over a fixed window.

**Clients** run on a pseudo-terminal of 200x50 that answers what an
xterm-class terminal answers (cursor position, device attributes, cell size,
palette) and claims nothing newer — a client that believed the terminal spoke
the kitty keyboard protocol would read the latency scenario's keys
differently. Everything a client prints is drained continuously, so no client
is ever stalled by a terminal that stopped reading.

**Statistics.** 5 repetitions after 1 warm-up repetition that is recorded
(marked) and left out. Median and p95 are nearest-rank, so both are values that
were actually observed; with 5 repetitions the p95 is the maximum. Latency
samples (100 per repetition) are pooled across repetitions, so its p95 is a
real percentile of 500. Hosts are interleaved inside each repetition, so a
slow drift of the machine lands on all three. Timing is done in the harness
with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`; `hyperfine` was not used, because most of these are
not "run a command N times".

**Niceness and load.** The timed runs ran at niceness 0; only the talos build
before them ran under `nice -n 10`. Every sample in the raw results carries the
1-minute load average at the start of its repetition (`load1`); the harness now
also records it when each sample ends (`load1_end`), which the latency re-run
below has and the other scenarios' committed data predates.

## The machine

A NixOS 26.05 machine with a 4-core Intel Core i5-6500T (2.5 GHz, one thread
per core, `powersave` governor), 15.5 GiB of RAM, Linux 6.18, dedicated to the
run and otherwise idle (load average 0.2–0.4 before each run). Python 3.13 ran
the harness and the stand-in. talos reports itself as `0.0.0-dev`, which is
what a build from a checkout is; the commit it was built from is recorded in
the results.

## Threats to validity

- **One machine, and an old one.** Four cores of a 2015 desktop CPU with the
  `powersave` governor. A faster machine shrinks every absolute number; it
  should not reorder them much, but ratios near 1 could flip.
- **The benchmark loads the machine itself.** Fifty Python agents starting
  push the 1-minute load average to ~2.7 on four cores during and just after
  the N=50 rounds; outside those it stayed under 1. One N=50 repetition of
  the resources scenario began at 7.4, the residue of the warm-up round before
  it (150 agents, and Herdr near a full core); its numbers sit inside the
  other repetitions' spread except Herdr's CPU under output, whose p95 is that
  sample. Hosts are interleaved inside every repetition, so all three ran
  under the same load, and no other work ran on the machine (load before each
  run: 0.2–0.4).
- **CPU windows miss short-lived processes.** A process that starts and exits
  inside a window is not counted. None of the three hosts runs one while idle
  except talos's once-a-minute heartbeat tick, timed separately (0.02 s of
  CPU a run).
- **A real agent may cost Herdr more or less.** Herdr classifies what runs in
  each pane (working, blocked, idle); the stand-in is not an agent it knows,
  and how much of Herdr's idle CPU is that classification was not isolated.
- **The stand-in is Python.** Its ~35 ms start is inside every "until the
  agent started" number, equally for all three. A real agent starts in
  seconds, which would swamp most create differences.
- **Herdr goes through a shell.** Its documented way to run a command in a new
  pane is `tab create` then `pane run`, which types the command into a shell.
  That is two CLI calls and a shell start per session where tmux and talos
  exec the command directly. It is what a Herdr user scripting sessions does,
  but it is not Herdr's floor.
- **Different defaults, measured as they come.** Scrollback (tmux 2 000 lines,
  talos's tmux 5 000 rows, Herdr 10 MB), headless window size (talos's
  80x24 against 200x50), and what each client draws around the pane. The
  scrollback table reports retention next to cost for that reason.
- **The terminal is a harness.** Clients draw into a pty the harness reads,
  not a terminal emulator, so what a real terminal spends parsing each
  client's output is not counted, and neither are the bytes each client
  writes to it.
- **Herdr's attach is bimodal** — about 50–70 ms or about 170–300 ms, with no
  cause found; answering its terminal queries did not change it, and
  attaching again within a second of a detach made the slow mode reliable. The
  attach scenario waits 3 s before reattaching; the medians above include
  whichever mode came up.
- **p95 over 5 repetitions is the maximum.** Treat the p95 columns as "worst
  seen" everywhere except latency, where it is over 500 pooled samples.
- **Three invocations.** `create` and `attach` come from one run, `latency`
  from a third and the other four scenarios from a second, the same day on the
  same machine and build. The first run stopped on a harness bug — a banner
  scrolled off screen before a client attached — fixed before the second.
  Latency was re-measured after review: the first method waited 20–60 ms after
  each echo, so a slower host was typed at more slowly. The fixed schedule
  moved no median by more than 1.4 ms (talos idle: 24.0 then 25.4).

## Re-running it

```sh
nix develop -c just bench-multiplexers                       # all of it
nix develop -c just bench-multiplexers --scenarios latency,attach --reps 10
nix develop -c just bench-multiplexers --hosts tmux,talos --no-build
```

`scripts/bench/run.sh` fetches the pinned Herdr release (checked against its
SHA-256) into `~/.cache/talos-bench/`, builds talos in release from the
checkout it is in, and runs `scripts/bench/run.py`, which writes
`results.json`, `results.csv` and `summary.md` under
`~/.cache/talos-bench/work/results-<timestamp>/`. Each scenario is also a
script of its own (`python3 scripts/bench/scenarios/latency.py --reps 3`).
Run it on a machine with nothing else busy, and look at `load1` in the results
before believing a number. Like `scripts/dev/perf-run.sh`, it refuses to run
where `TALOS_GATE` is exported: it is a benchmark, not a test, and a
validation step is the opposite of a quiet machine.
