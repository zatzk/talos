# Development

How to set up a reproducible talos dev environment and run the app in an
isolated sandbox.

## 1. Toolchain — the dev environment

### Recommended: Nix flake

The `flake.nix` provides the tools CI uses — the Rust toolchain (read from
`rust-toolchain.toml`), `tmux`, `shellcheck`, `bats`, Node, `cargo-nextest`,
`cargo-deny`, `cocogitto`, `just`, and the demo stack (`vhs`/`ffmpeg`/`ttyd`).
`flake.lock` pins nixpkgs, so the shell's tools move only when someone runs
`nix flake update`; the Rust toolchain still follows `stable` from
`rust-toolchain.toml`. The same flake also packages talos itself
(`nix/package.nix`), which CI's `nix` job builds; the rest of CI installs its
tools without Nix, so the shell is a local convenience, not what CI runs.

```bash
# one-time, if not done already: enable flakes
#   mkdir -p ~/.config/nix && echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf

nix develop           # enter the pinned shell
# ...or, with direnv installed, once:
direnv allow          # auto-enters the shell on `cd` (see .envrc)
```

A couple of tools aren't packaged in nixpkgs yet (`prek`, `rumdl`, nightly
`cargo-pup`); the shell prints a hint to install them via
`scripts/install-dev-tools.sh`.

### Fallback: no Nix

```bash
scripts/install-dev-tools.sh   # cargo-binstall/cargo install the dev tools
prek install                   # install the git hooks
```

You'll also need, from your package manager: `tmux >= 3.2`, `shellcheck`,
`bats`, Node + npm (website linters), `git`, and the three Lua gates `just lint`
runs — `selene`, `stylua` and `lua-language-server`. Run `npm ci` once, or
`just fmt`'s website half exits 127 on a fresh checkout.

For opt-in RMUX sessions, install RMUX >= 0.10.0 separately; the dev flake
provides tmux. [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md#multiplexer-requirements-and-rmux-setup)
records version evidence and RMUX platform limits.

## 2. Everyday tasks — `just`

`just` (in the dev shell) is the task entrypoint — run `just` for the list:

| Task | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `just build` | build the dev binaries (`talos` + `talos-cli`) |
| `just test` | `cargo nextest run --all` |
| `just test-scripts` | the bats suites: `scripts/install.bats` + the pull-request-title checker (needs `bats`) |
| `just lint` | fmt-check + clippy + cargo-deny + rumdl + shellcheck + selene, stylua and lua-language-server |
| `just fmt` | format Rust + website |
| `just arch` | architecture-rule + rustdoc checks |
| `just hooks-install` | `prek install` |
| `just smoke` | black-box TUI test: the real binary on a pty (`tests/tui_e2e.rs`) |
| `just reap-tmux` | reap orphaned *test* tmux servers a signal left behind (below) |
| `just bench` | what a frame costs, piece by piece (`benches/frame_cost.rs`) |
| `just perf` | what the whole binary costs under load (`scripts/dev/perf-run.sh`) |
| `just sandbox*` | dev runtime sandbox (below) |

### `just reap-tmux` — the servers a guard could not reap

Every harness that starts a tmux server holds a `TmuxServer`
(`tests/support/tmux_server.rs`), whose `Drop` kills it. That covers every way
a test ends in-process, a panic included, which is what teardown spelled as a
`cleanup()` call at each exit point did not: the socket file lives in a
directory the run owns, so a test that skipped its teardown left a server with
no socket, unreachable by the very command that would have killed it. One
machine reached 400 of those, with 4 sockets between 433 servers.

A destructor cannot run for a signal, though — a nextest `slow-timeout`
termination, `kill -9`, an OOM kill — so that one case still leaks, and
`just reap-tmux` is the sweep for it. It kills only processes that are both a
tmux **server** of yours on one of the suite's own socket names and unreachable
(no socket file), which is why it can never touch `talos`, `talos-dev` or
anything you are attached to. `just reap-tmux --dry-run` lists without killing.
Linux only: the socket directory is read from `/proc/<pid>/environ`, and there
is no portable equivalent.

`just bench` and `just perf` are the two measuring instruments, and they answer
different questions: the bench times the *pieces* of a frame against the real
`ui/`, while `just perf` runs the whole binary against real tmux panes and
reports CPU. Neither is in CI — wall-clock timing stays out of the gate
(ADR-P5) — and a claim from either is a paired before/after at a stated
terminal size and session count, never a single absolute number. Both are
explained in [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md).

## 3. Runtime sandbox — run talos isolated

The sandbox runs the dev build (`0.0.0-dev` → `dev_build` cfg, which uses a
`talos-dev` tmux socket) with **talos's own config/data redirected** into the
sandbox (via `TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` / `TALOS_DATA_DIR`), so it never touches your
real `~/.config/talos` or sessions. It **keeps your real `HOME`**, so your
authenticated agent CLIs (`claude`/`codex`/`antigravity`/…) work normally — and it puts
the dev `target/debug` first on `PATH`, so an agent's status hook calls *this*
`talos-cli` and writes to the sandbox DB the TUI reads. The tmux socket is
scoped twice over: a private `TMUX_TMPDIR`, and `TALOS_SOCKET` naming the
server outright — a relocated `TALOS_DATA_DIR` derives a socket of its own
(`docs/CONFIG.md` → Relocating an instance), and teardown kills the socket by
name.

```bash
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh                 # persistent "default" profile, launch the TUI
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --fresh         # throwaway env, wiped on exit
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --profile foo   # a named persistent profile
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --isolate-home  # full hermetic isolation (fresh HOME; agents have NO creds)
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --shell         # a shell with the sandbox env (run talos-cli by hand)
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh -- session list # run a talos-cli command in the sandbox
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --clean [name]  # kill + wipe a persistent profile
```

Or via `just`: `just sandbox`, `just sandbox-fresh`,
`just sandbox-shell`, `just sandbox-clean [profile]`.

The sandbox points `TALOS_CONFIG_DIR` at its own root, so the interface
materialises at `<sandbox>/talos-config/ui/` along with agents, settings and the
database. `--fresh` is therefore a clean first-run interface every time — which is
how the plugin lifecycle (delivery, removal, restore) is exercised without touching
your real one.

The TUI is launched **from the sandbox root rather than the repo**. Where you
stand no longer decides which interface loads, so this is belt-and-braces.

To run the dev TUI against **this checkout's** `ui/` instead of a copy, ask for it:
`just tui-ui` (which sets `TALOS_UI_DIR`).

**Isolation flavors:**

- **talos-only (default)** — real `HOME`/agents; only `talos-config` +
  `talos-data` (+ a private `TMUX_TMPDIR`) are redirected. Use this to dev with
  your real, logged-in agents without polluting your real talos state.
- **full (`--isolate-home`)** — also overrides `HOME` + `XDG_*`, so the env is
  hermetic and agents boot with no credentials. This is what `scripts/demo/
  record.sh` uses (via `tbx_sandbox_init_full`).

**Profile lifetimes:**

- **Persistent** profiles live under `target/dev-sandbox/<profile>/` (gitignored;
  `cargo clean` or `--clean` removes them). Their tmux socket dir is kept short
  under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (AF_UNIX socket paths are length-limited, and the
  repo's `target/` path is often too long). Sessions survive across runs.
- **Fresh** (`--fresh`) is a `mktemp` dir wiped on exit — same isolation the
  demo recorder uses.

The isolation logic is one helper, `scripts/dev/lib/sandbox-env.sh`, sourced by
`scripts/dev/sandbox.sh` and `scripts/demo/record.sh` (one source of truth).
`tests/tui_e2e.rs` isolates the same way in Rust — private profile dirs, a short
private `TMUX_TMPDIR` — so it never touches a real profile either.

### Example: watch a session's status hook end-to-end

```bash
scripts/dev/sandbox.sh --shell
# inside the sandbox shell (talos/talos-cli target the sandbox):
talos-cli session create --name demo --repo-path "$PWD" --agent claude
talos-cli session signal --state blocked --session <id>   # what an agent hook does
talos-cli session list --json | jq '.[].name'
```
