-- The arrangement.
--
-- v1 hardcoded this in Rust (`ui::layout::compute_layout`) with its breakpoints
-- baked into the binary. Here it is a function of the available size, so the
-- thresholds below are yours to change — edit, save, and the next frame uses
-- them.
--
-- It only ARRANGES. It never calls a plugin, so a mistake here cannot break one
-- (and a broken plugin cannot break this).
--
-- It runs BEFORE any plugin renders, which is what lets the kernel tell each
-- plugin the rect it is drawing into — and why the open/closed state of a
-- column lives in `lib.panels` rather than inside the plugin that fills it.
--
-- The interface is two panes between three chrome bands:
--
--   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐ header  (kernel)
--   ├──────────┬──────────────────────────────┤
--   │ sessions │           center             │
--   │  (25%)   │        (remainder)           │
--   ├──────────┴──────────────────────────────┤
--   │ status                                  │ only when there is a message
--   ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
--   │ footer                                  │ (kernel)
--   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
--
-- `header`, `status` and `footer` are BANDS: the kernel fills them, this file
-- decides whether and where they appear. Move one, reorder them, or delete a
-- line to drop it — the kernel neither knows nor minds. What a band CONTAINS is
-- not arrangement, so it is not decided here.
--
-- v1's other columns (info, tasks, files) were removed along with their
-- plugins; their slots went too, because a slot no plugin can fill is a rect
-- reserved for nothing. Re-adding a pane means adding its slot back here — which
-- is the whole reason the arrangement is a file you can edit rather than a
-- layout compiled into the binary. `search` is the first one back.
--
-- The centre pane is never dropped: it takes whatever the session column leaves.
-- That is the point of the split — v1 was built to avoid swapping between panes,
-- so the list SITS BESIDE the terminal rather than replacing it.
--
-- The status band costs nothing while it is quiet: the kernel draws nothing into
-- it when there is no message, and the row it would occupy is only carved when
-- `status_rows()` below says there is something to say.

local panels = require("lib.panels")

-- v1 `Settings::two_panel_min_cols`, and now the user's own value.
--
-- The fallback is not decoration: the arrangement runs before anything else and
-- must never fail closed, so a kernel that published nothing still gets v1's
-- default rather than a screen with no panes on it.

-- v1 `split_vertical`: below 20 rows the header is dropped so the panes get
-- every row there is. The bands are surrendered identity-first — it is the least
-- urgent row on screen — and the message band last, because a hidden error is
-- the failure this chrome exists to prevent.
local HEADER_MIN_ROWS = 20

-- Rows the search strip asks for: its frame, the query, a group header and a
-- handful of results. Clamped against the terminal below, so a short screen
-- gives it less rather than losing the panes underneath it.

--- Does the status band have anything to say?
---
--- The kernel publishes this rather than the message itself: what a band shows
--- is not the arrangement's business, but whether it needs a row is.

--- Will a loaded plugin actually paint into `slot`?
---
--- Removing a pane takes two switches and they are not the same kind of thing:
--- the panel toggle below is ARRANGEMENT state (F9, mine to decide), while the
--- disabled set is DELIVERY state (settings → Interface → space, the kernel's).
--- Reserving a rect needs both to agree, because a slot no plugin can fill is a
--- rect reserved for nothing — the same reason v1's info/tasks/files slots left
--- with their plugins. Consulting only the toggle is what left a turned-off
--- session list as an empty quarter-width column.
---
--- Only optional PLUGIN columns are gated on this. The chrome bands are drawn by
--- the kernel and belong to no plugin, and `center` is never dropped, so neither
--- appears in `ctx.slots` and neither may ask.
---
--- Unknown answers count as filled. The arrangement runs before anything else
--- and must never fail closed: a kernel that published no slot table at all
--- should still get the interface it had, not a screen with a pane missing.
