# You are working in talos's interface

This directory **is** the running interface of talos, a multi-session
coding-agent orchestrator. Every pane on its screen is a Lua file here. Saving a
file reloads it; there is no build step.

`README.md` beside this file is the reference — the node kinds, the sizing rules,
what you can read and write. This file is the part that is easy to get wrong.

The first habit: **start from `lib/ui.lua`**, the component layer, not from raw
nodes. `ui.panel` is a framed pane in the one focus convention this interface
has (pass `focused = ctx.focused`; README.md → **Focus** says what that buys),
`ui.list` is a scrolling list with the window arithmetic and the selection
bar already in it, `ui.cursor` is the "which item am I on, and did somebody
else steer me" state every pane with a list grows, `ui.row` is a span builder that knows
how wide the row is, and `ui.empty`/`ui.footer` are the one empty state and the
one footer — with hints resolved from the key registry, so a rebind moves them.
`10_sessions.lua` and `80_restore.lua` are the worked examples. `lib/widgets.lua`
is the primitive kit underneath; reach past `ui` for the piece it does not cover.

A second habit, for when you do: a highlight is a **node style**, not a loop over
spans. `{ type = "text", style = { bg = … } }` covers the whole rect, so a bar
reaches the right edge without a padding span and a span that names its own
colour survives it. `ui.list` and `widgets.list` both do this for you.

A third: a border is a **`frame`**, never hand-drawn cells. It takes styled
title runs, `title_align`, `border_type` and an `overlay` that paints onto its
own border cells (`top_left`/`top_right`/`bottom_left`/`bottom_right`/
`right_column`) — a status strip, a scroll count or a scrollbar there costs no
content cell. And a run inside a line carries its own `id`/`role`, so a chip is a
click target without becoming a sized node; adjacent runs sharing an identity are
one hitbox.

## "Install a plugin" means `talos-cli plugin install`

A *plugin* here is a talos interface pane, not a package from a language
registry. If someone asks you to install one:

```bash
talos-cli plugin available          # what installs by bare name
talos-cli plugin install <name>     # or a URL, or a path
talos-cli plugin install git+<url>  # a repository: cloned, payload and all
talos-cli plugin sync               # after editing plugins.toml by hand
```

A plugin that carries a program or a data file is a **repository**, and `git+<url>`
(or a `.git` suffix, or `git@host:path`) clones it into `<interface dir>/<name>/`,
keeping its `.git`. Say plainly what that does before running it: **it puts that
repository's files on the user's disk, executables included.** Nothing is executed by
installing, and a program still needs the `program` capability the user grants — but
the files are theirs now, so do not install a repository the user did not name.

`talos.platform` gives a pane `os` and `arch`, which is how a plugin shipping
several binaries picks one. The manifest does not do it for you.

**Never build under this directory, and never write inside an installed plugin's
working copy.** Two different reasons, both easy to trip over if you make a pane fetch
or compile something:

- This directory is watched *recursively*, so an `npm install` here fires thousands of
  events. The symptom is not "reloads too often" — a burst keeps the debounce rolling
  forward, so it **stops reloading at all** while you are busy.
- Anything you generate inside a cloned plugin's own directory makes its git tree
  dirty, and a dirty tree is what makes `plugin update` refuse to move it. You would
  be making the plugin un-updatable to save a path.

Put generated files in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/<plugin>/` (or `~/.cache/<plugin>/`).

**There is no `npm`, `cargo`, `pip` or `go get` in this directory, and nothing to
run one on.** No `package.json`, no lockfile of that kind, no `node_modules`. The
only dependencies a pane has are the modules in `lib/` — ui, widgets, theme,
fuzzy, textinput, chrome, modal, scroll, order, settings, panels, hover, tree, and
the session-list/path-picker/repo-picker models — which are already here and are
reached with `require("lib.ui")`. If you find yourself about to run a
package manager, you have misread the request.

`plugins.toml` records what this interface is composed of and `plugins.lock` what
each entry resolved to. You may edit the first by hand; never hand-edit the second.

## Check your work after every edit

```bash
talos-cli plugin check
```

It loads the interface exactly as talos does and **exits non-zero** on failure.
Do not report an edit as done without it. It catches four things, and the three
after the first are the ones that look like success:

- a file that will not load, named with its reason;
- a pane that **loads and draws nothing**, because no arrangement places its slot.
  It compiles, declares its keys, appears in listings, and is absent from the
  screen. `check` prints the `layout.lua` line to add.
- a **pill the action band drops**, because no chord resolves for its action. The
  pane draws, the button does not, and `check` says which mistake it was: an
  action that exists only as a chord-less `commands` entry, or one nothing
  loaded declares at all. A warning, so it does not fail the exit.
- a **chord somebody else already claimed**. Two global claims on one key both
  load and both are placed; the earlier declaration keeps the key, or a user's
  rebinding does, and the other never fires. `check` names both claimants and
  which one wins, the kernel's own chords included, so a pane taking `F1` is
  told rather than quietly displacing help. A warning too.

`check` loads; it does not read names. The mistakes it cannot see are the quiet
ones — a node prop the kernel drops, a command option no verb reads, a theme role
no palette defines — and `lib/talos.d.lua` is what turns those into findings:

```bash
lua-language-server --check . --checklevel=Warning
```

Annotate the node you build (`---@type talos.TextNode` above the table) so a
misspelt prop reads back as a missing required field. An **extra** key is never
reported, so the annotation is what does the work.

## Measure in columns

A terminal budget is columns, and Lua counts neither of the two things it can
count for you: `#` is bytes and `utf8.len` is codepoints, so a CJK glyph — one
codepoint, two columns — comes out a column short every time. The kernel
measures instead: `text.width(s)`, `text.truncate(s, cols, opts)` and
`text.pad(s, cols, align)`, with the same `unicode-width` the painter uses. The
`widgets` helpers (`len`, `truncate`, `truncate_hard`, `keep_left`,
`keep_right`, `middle_truncate`, `pad`) forward to them, so either spelling is
right. The one count that is *not* columns is `input.cursor`, a character
offset — `widgets.chars` is that.

## Adding a pane is two edits

The plugin file, **and** its slot in `layout.lua`. A pane names a slot; the
arrangement decides where that slot goes. Miss the second and you get the
silent-but-loading failure above. `talos-cli plugin install` prints the line for
you.

There is a quieter version of the same failure: a slot in **`switch`** mode shows one
occupant and keeps the rest as alternates, so a pane that is not first draws nothing
until it is focused. It loads, it is placed, every check passes, and the screen does not
change. **Declare a pill** and the action band offers it:

```lua
pills = { { action = "mine.open", label = "Mine", priority = 10 } },
```

`plugin check` warns about a pane in that state and `plugin install` says it when you
install one — neither fails, because you may have meant it.

## Make the pane cost what changed, not what exists

`render` runs on the UI thread up to thirty times a second. Three habits keep a
pane from being the thing that makes the whole interface feel slow:

- **Declare `pure = true` unless the render writes.** The kernel then reuses
  your last tree until something you read changes, and skips your Lua on every
  other frame. It is only wrong if `render` writes `store`/`state` or calls
  `command` — move those into
  `on_key`/`on_action`/`on_click`/`on_context`/`on_outside`/`on_scroll`/`on_event`. Floats
  especially: a float renders every frame *even while closed*.
- **Memoize on table identity.** The published groups (`talos.sessions`,
  `talos.theme`, `talos.registry`, `talos.bookmarks`, …) keep the *same
  table* until their data moves, so `rawequal(talos.sessions, cache.src)` is
  a sound one-comparison test that a derived model is still valid.
  `10_sessions`'s model and the flow's row cache are the pattern to copy.
- **Window first, build second.** Compute the visible rows (`widgets.window`)
  before building spans; hoist `store` reads, `theme.role` lookups and
  `fuzzy.compile(query)` out of per-row loops; accumulate wide strings through
  a table (`table.concat`), never `s = s .. piece` across a row.

`F12` opens the perf HUD. `renders` climbing while you touch nothing means a
pane is not settling — usually an impure render, or a per-frame `store` write
of a fresh table (writing the same *value* is free; a new table never is).

**Finding the slow pane:** `F12`, then read the `panes` table under the
counters — most expensive first, the worst in red, `!` where a hint applies.
Then `talos-cli perf --plugins` prints every column for every pane, with the
hint spelled out (not pure but rendering every frame, a float rendering while
closed, fresh tables written to `store` from a render, a pure pane re-rendering
while idle); add `--json` to script it. A `slow op` in the output names the pane
whose call took the time.

## What you cannot do from a pane

- **No `os`, `io`, `debug`, `package`, `print`, `dofile`, `load`.** They are not
  blocked, they are *missing*: `os.time()` is `attempt to index a nil value`, not a
  permission error. The VM enforces it, so `plugin check` is what catches it here —
  the static lint that also enforces it needs the talos checkout's own config.
- **No blocking.** Reads come from a snapshot and return instantly; writes are
  `command(...)` calls the kernel applies later. There is nothing to await. Two of
  those writes reach outside your own rect: `command("message", { text =, level = })`
  says something in the kernel's message band, and `command("action", { text =
  "help.open" })` runs a declared action — which is how a **key handler** opens
  help, settings, themes or the palette, rather than painting a `role =
  "action:…"` node and hoping for a click.
- **No granting yourself a capability.** A pane that wants to run a program says so
  with `capabilities = { … }`, and the *user* grants it in settings
  (`Ctrl+,` → `]` → `t`). You cannot do that step for them, and you should not
  edit `ui.json` to fake it. Draw the untrusted state honestly instead.

## What `lib/` promises a file that calls it

Talos never overwrites a file you edited. So an edited `layout.lua` or pane
stays as it was while an upgrade keeps updating the untouched `lib/` files it
calls. Every third-party pane is in the same position. `lib/` therefore keeps one
promise, and it is everything such a file may rely on:

- **Every name a module returns stays.** Anything in the table
  `require("lib.<name>")` returns (`panels.shown`, `ui.list`, `theme.role`, …)
  keeps its name and its kind: a function stays a function, a table stays a
  table.
- **A call that worked keeps working.** A new parameter is optional and
  trailing, or a new field of an options table. Arguments an old caller passes
  keep their meaning. A result may gain fields but never loses or retypes one.
- **A retired name stays as a shim.** It forwards to its replacement and is
  never removed.

Nothing else is promised: a module's `local` functions, its private state, the
exact styles and text it draws, or writes into a module's tables.
`talos.d.lua` is types, not a module.

This is a compatibility promise rather than a version number. A preserved file is
frozen at whichever release it was edited in. A version could only tell that file
it no longer fits; it could not make it work. Side-by-side copies of `lib/` would
mean landing every fix once per copy, and published plugins declare no version to
pin to. The talos repository's test suite holds `lib/` to this promise. It
loads edited files frozen from an old release, and it pins a list of every
exported name.

The promise runs one way: **do not edit a `lib/` file.** An edited one stops
receiving updates too, and the next release's panes will call names it lacks.
Put your own helpers in a module of your own, such as `lib/mine.lua`.

## Do not break the way back

`layout.lua` and `lib/` are shared by every pane; a mistake there takes the whole
screen, not one pane. Prefer adding a file over editing those two. Anything shipped
with talos can be restored (`Ctrl+,` → `]` → `r`), so a bad edit is recoverable —
but only if you say what you changed. Restoring an edited `layout.lua` keeps your
copy as `layout.lua.bak` (then `.bak.2`, never over an earlier one).

A file **you** added has no shipped copy to restore, so the way back for it is
`space` on its row in that same tab: turned off, untouched on disk, and the
interface loads without it. `talos-cli plugin check` reports the failure with no
TTY, which is the one you can run yourself.
