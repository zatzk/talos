-- another instance deleted, and ones deleted before talos was last restarted.
--
-- It knows nothing about how a restore works. `talos.deleted` is the read and
-- `restore` is the command; whether a row's worktrees can be reattached is the
-- kernel's problem, and whether a force-deleted one SHOULD be is a question put
-- through `store.confirm` — the same confirmation the session list uses for a
-- delete, which is why there is no bespoke `ConfirmRestore` here.
