-- The new-session flow.
--
-- v1 spent five modals, a 46-field wizard struct (`NewSessionWizardState`), three
-- background tasks and a generation counter on this. Here it is one file: a step
-- machine over reads the kernel publishes, ending in one `create` command.
--
-- The steps are v1's, in v1's order, and each is skipped exactly where v1 skips
-- it:
--
--   host  → repo → [base branch] → name → [branch name] → [agent] → create
--
-- plus a detour off the repo step for a typed path that does not exist yet:
--
--   repo → new folder (git init / leave it empty) → repo
--                     (clone into it)         → clone URL → repo
--
-- `host` is skipped when nothing is configured, `base branch` and `branch name`
-- only appear when some repository is in worktree mode, and `agent` is skipped
-- when there is one or none. Nothing here waits: every listing, path check and
-- branch list is a READ the kernel serves from a worker
-- (`kernel::repos`), asked for by leaving a key in `store`.
--
-- WHY ONE PLUGIN AND NOT SIX. The kernel renders every floating plugin each
-- frame purely to discover it is not floating, so six closed modals would cost
-- six Lua calls a frame forever. They also share one thing — the pending choice
-- — which as six plugins would have to live in `store` as a protocol between
-- panes that only ever run in sequence.
--
-- WHERE A REFUSAL APPEARS. v1 puts "Not a git repo…" in the status bar. A plugin
-- cannot write the message band (it is kernel chrome), so a refusal this flow
-- makes itself is shown on its own footer row instead. A refusal from the
-- *kernel* — a path that does not exist, a folder with no repositories — comes
-- back as a failed command and the band reports it, as it does for every command.
