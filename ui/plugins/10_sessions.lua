-- The session list.
--
-- In v1 this was `ui::project_list` — 2,212 lines of Rust, welded to a 616-method
-- `App` struct. Here it is a file you can edit while talos is running.
--
-- It is an ORDINARY plugin. The kernel has no session-list concept: it hands
-- over a snapshot and this decides everything about how the list looks.
--
-- Session rows retain v1's nesting marks, selection bar, status strip and
-- scroll indicators. Host and repo rows provide fold handles above them.
--
-- The border is an ordinary kernel `frame`, and this file no longer spells it:
-- `ui.panel` does. It was drawn by hand, out of a cell buffer, for as long as a
-- frame title was a plain unstyled left-aligned string — a frame could express
-- none of the three things v1 puts on this border. It can now: the title is
-- styled runs, so the focused badge is a title; the dot strip and the scroll
-- counts are `frame.overlay`, painted onto the border cells after the block,
-- which is what keeps them off the content rows.
--
-- What is left here is the DECISIONS — which glyph, which colour role, when to
-- drop a trailing status, what a repo row says — while the window
-- arithmetic, the selection bar, the empty state and the focus border are
-- `lib/ui`'s, shared with every other pane.

-- ── The model, the components and the ordering algebra live in lib/ ─────────
--
-- `lib.session_model` builds the item list (one selectable unit per row), `lib.ui` is the
-- component layer — the panel, the list, the cursor and the row builder, and
-- with them the window arithmetic, the selection bar and the focus border this
-- pane used to spell itself — and `lib.order` is the move/sort algebra over the
-- rendered items. All three are pure over what this pane hands them; everything
-- about how a row LOOKS stays here.

-- ── Turning a model item into lines ────────────────────────────────────────

--- The status text that follows the name. v1 shows the agent's notification (or
--- the word "Blocked") for a blocked row, and the OSC activity title otherwise;
--- a row with neither carries no text, because the coloured dot already says
--- what state it is in.
---
--- Both come off the agent's own terminal — the activity line is its OSC window
--- title, the notification its OSC 9/777 message — so they are published from
--- the live pane rather than the database.
---
--- v2 adds the row nothing has reported for. Its dot says only that no status
--- arrived, which is honest but not diagnosable, so the text names what talos
--- does know: the agent found in the pane, or why the silence means nothing.
--- Naming the agent never displaces what it said — an activity line is the
--- agent talking, and it wins the rest of the line.
