-- Global search.
--
-- v1's is one strip that searches every scope at once and highlights the matches
-- **in the panes themselves** rather than reprinting them here. That is the
-- design decision worth preserving: results you can see in place are results you
-- can judge without leaving the list you were already reading — which is also
-- why this is a strip and not a float. A float would cover the rows it is
-- pointing at.
--
-- Two kinds of result, in two sections:
--
--   * **sessions** — a session whose name, agent, branch or repository matches.
--     Matched here, every frame, with `lib.fuzzy`, the same matcher the session
--     list lights its own rows with, so the two cannot disagree.
--   * **text** — a LINE in a session's terminals: everything its agent pane and
--     its shell still hold, scrollback included, not just what is on screen.
--     That is thousands of lines per session, so the kernel reads and matches it
--     on a worker (`kernel::search`) and this pane draws the answer a frame or
--     two later. The query is left in `store` under `want_content` once it has
--     stood still, and the answer arrives as `talos.search`.
--
-- Selecting a result PREVIEWS it, whether an arrow or a query put the cursor
-- there: the session list's cursor moves to the result, and for a text hit the
-- agent pane scrolls back to the line and marks it, while focus stays here.
-- `esc` puts back what you were looking at; `enter` keeps the jump and lands
-- you in the terminal, on the line.
--
-- The query language is `lib.fuzzy.query`'s: words (all must match, any order),
-- "quoted phrases", /regex/ (text only), `in:<session>` and `repo:<repo>`
-- filters, smart case. `tab` cycles what is searched: everything, text only,
-- or names only.
