-- The component layer: what a pane is made of, spelled once.
--
-- `lib/widgets.lua` is the primitive kit — measurement, windowing, a row of
-- text. This is the layer above it: the handful of shapes every pane in this
-- interface turns out to be, with the conventions that make them look like one
-- program rather than six.
--
-- The conventions, and why they are here rather than in each pane:
--
--   * **One focus border.** A panel's border and title come from
--     `lib/chrome`: thick and marked with focus, thin and quiet without. Three
--     panes had grown three different answers to "what does focused look
--     like", and a fourth pane copied whichever it was written next to.
--   * **One selection idiom.** A selected row is a full-width bar
--     (`selection_bg`/`selection_fg`), painted as the row's own `style`, never
--     a marker glyph eating two columns of every row. Hover is the same band
--     with the foreground left alone.
--   * **One empty state.** A blank line, the sentence centred, and — when
--     something is actually bound to it — the chord that fixes it, also
--     centred.
--   * **One footer.** Hints are resolved from the key registry, so a rebind
--     moves the hint with the key and a removed action takes its hint with it.
--
-- Everything here composes the four kernel node kinds. Nothing here is a node
-- kind, and nothing here is appearance the kernel decides: a pane still says
-- which glyph, which role and when to drop a trailing status. What it no
-- longer says is how a window is computed, where a selection bar comes from,
-- or what a border looks like when the pane has focus.

-- ── Status ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

--- Glyph and colour for a session status, with the moving ones animated.
---
--- `theme.status` answers the static half; the spinner is for the statuses
--- whose glyph depends on the frame, and every pane that draws a status was
--- choosing between the two itself.
---
--- Two statuses animate, on different evidence. `working` is the agent's own
--- report that a turn is running. `running` is talos's observation that an
--- agent holds the pane and has said nothing — which on its own cannot tell a
--- turn in flight from a prompt waiting for input, so it animates only while
--- `printing` says that pane is actually producing output. That is the same
--- signal `with_output_quiescence` trusts in the other direction, and it is
--- what keeps the spinner a report rather than a guess: quiet, it falls back
--- to the static glyph.
---
--- `printing` comes from `talos.printing`, which only a surface holding the
--- terminals can fill. A caller that passes nothing gets the static answer,
--- which is the honest one when nobody looked.

--- A framed pane, in the one focus convention this interface has.
---
--- Passing `focused = ctx.focused` is the whole of what a pane does to opt in:
--- the thick border, the ` ▸ ` mark, the title badge and the two border roles
--- all come from `lib/chrome` (see its "Focus styling" section for why focus is
--- a shape and a mark as well as a colour). `level` overrides the mapping for a
--- pane that wants `active` — lit without focus.
---
--- The overlays paint onto the border cells the block already drew, so a status
--- strip, a scroll count or a scrollbar costs no content row and no content
--- column.
---
--- A `body` built by `ui.list` with `on_overflow = "border"` carries its own
--- hidden-row counts, and they are laid over the top-right and bottom-right
--- overlays here rather than by the pane.
