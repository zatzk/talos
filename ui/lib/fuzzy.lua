-- characters have to appear in order, but not together — `fb` finds `foo-bar`.
-- Plain substring matching would not, and that is the whole difference between a
-- search you type three letters into and one you have to spell for.
--
-- It lives here rather than inside the search pane because two panes need the
-- same answer: search decides WHAT matches, and the pane holding the row decides
-- how to draw it — and they must agree on which characters hit, or the
-- highlight lands on the wrong letters.
--
-- Positions are CHARACTER indices, 1-based, not byte offsets. The Rust version
-- returns byte positions because its caller slices bytes; here the caller slices
-- with `widgets` helpers, which count characters.
