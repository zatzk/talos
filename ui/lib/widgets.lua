-- The widget library.
--
-- THIS FILE IS THE POINT. The kernel ships four primitives — text, box, input,
-- surface — and nothing else. Lists, panels, gauges and dividers live here, in
-- Lua, composed from those four.
--
-- A prior attempt at v2 specified a library like this, never built it, and
-- watched its "frozen" 6-kind node catalog grow to 16 because every new
-- appearance had nowhere else to go. Each one cost a Rust enum variant, a
-- converter arm, a renderer arm, type definitions and a release. Everything
-- below costs a file save.
--
-- So: when you need a new appearance, add it in Lua. Adding a node kind to the
-- kernel is a design decision, not a shortcut.
--
-- Which of the two Lua files, though: this one is the PRIMITIVE KIT — measuring,
-- windowing, a row of text, a bar. `lib/ui.lua` is the component layer above it,
-- and it is what a pane should reach for first: a panel, a list, a cursor, a row
-- builder, an empty state, a footer, and with them the conventions that make
-- several panes look like one program. A new appearance that a pane composes is
-- this file's; a new SHAPE, with a convention attached, is `ui`'s.

local hover = require("lib.hover")
local theme = require("lib.theme")

local widgets = {}

--- A bordered panel's frame. Pass ctx.focused so the focused pane is marked.
---
--- Kept for a pane that already calls it, in the shape it always returned: a
--- STRING title, `borders` and `padding`, which a preserved pane may read. The
--- focus convention rides beside them — `lib/chrome`'s border glyphs and
--- colour, and its marked label; the title takes the border's colour, so it is
--- a plain string and not `chrome.frame`'s badge. A new pane reaches the whole
--- convention through `ui.panel`. `lib/chrome` is required here rather than at
--- the top because it requires this file.
function widgets.panel(title, focused)
  local chrome = require("lib.chrome")
  local level = chrome.level(focused)
  return {
    title = chrome.label(title, level),
    borders = "all",
    padding = 0,
    border_type = chrome.border_type(level),
    border_style = chrome.border_style(level),
  }
end

--- Clamp `value` into [1, count]; returns 1 when the list is empty.
function widgets.clamp(value, count)
  if count <= 0 then
    return 1
  end
  return math.max(1, math.min(value or 1, count))
end

--- Which slice of `count` rows is visible in `height` rows, keeping `selected`
--- on screen.
---
--- This is the function that could not exist before the layout pass: it needs
--- the pane's RESOLVED height, which a plugin only has because the kernel
--- resolves rects before calling render.
---
--- Returns first, last (1-based, inclusive) and whether rows are hidden above
--- and below.
function widgets.window(count, height, selected)
  if count <= 0 or height <= 0 then
    return 1, 0, false, false
  end
  if count <= height then
    return 1, count, false, false
  end
  selected = widgets.clamp(selected, count)
  -- Centre the selection, then push the window back inside the list.
  local first = selected - math.floor(height / 2)
  first = math.max(1, math.min(first, count - height + 1))
  local last = first + height - 1
  return first, last, first > 1, last < count
end

--- Width in terminal COLUMNS — what every layout here budgets in.
---
--- Lua has no way to compute this: `#` counts bytes and `utf8.len` counts
--- codepoints, and a CJK glyph is one codepoint over two columns while a
--- combining mark is one codepoint over none. So the kernel measures, with the
--- same `unicode-width` the painter uses, and a budget computed here agrees
--- with what lands on the screen.
---
--- Use `widgets.chars` instead for a caret: `input.cursor` is a CHARACTER
--- offset, and columns would put it in the wrong place in exactly the text
--- this function exists for.
---@param str string
---@return integer
function widgets.len(str)
  return text.width(str)
end

--- Count of characters, for the one job columns cannot do: placing a caret.
---@param str string
---@return integer
function widgets.chars(str)
  return utf8.len(str) or #str
end

--- Truncate to `width` columns, marking the cut with an ellipsis.
function widgets.truncate(str, width)
  return text.truncate(str, width)
end

--- Truncate to `max` columns, marking the cut with an ellipsis — but return
--- NOTHING at `max <= 1` rather than a bare `…`.
---
--- v1's `ui::truncate_ellipsis`, and the counterpart to `widgets.truncate`
--- rather than a variant of it: the difference is what a one-column budget
--- means. For a NAME, `…` still says "there is a name here, it did not fit", so
--- `truncate` keeps it. For a status or a badge composed beside other segments,
--- a lone ellipsis carries nothing and costs the column something else could
--- have used, so this drops it.
---
--- Both bundled panes had grown their own copy of this, each with a comment
--- explaining why it was not `widgets.truncate`. That is the signal that the
--- library was missing a variant, not that the callers were wrong — so it lives
--- here now and the forks are gone.
function widgets.truncate_hard(str, max)
  if max <= 1 and text.width(str) > max then
    return ""
  end
  return text.truncate(str, max)
end

--- Keep the FIRST `max` columns, adding nothing.
---
--- What a left-aligned border title does when it overruns its area: ratatui
--- truncates the far side and marks the cut in no way at all. Use this when you
--- are MATCHING that behaviour; use `truncate`/`truncate_hard` when you are
--- telling the reader something was cut.
function widgets.keep_left(str, max)
  return text.truncate(str, max, "")
end

--- Keep the LAST `max` columns.
---
--- What a right-aligned border title does when it overruns: ratatui's
--- `Line::render_with_alignment` skips from the left, so the title shrinks
--- toward the right edge. v1's recorded frame shows exactly this — a 42-char
--- title in a 40-wide pane renders as `╭-osc52 (claude) …`.
function widgets.keep_right(str, max)
  return text.truncate(str, max, { ellipsis = "", side = "left" })
end

--- Truncate in the MIDDLE, keeping both ends.
---
--- For a path, the head says where you are and the leaf says which one it is, and
--- the leaf is the half an end-truncation throws away: a repo picker offering
--- `/home/me/.local/share/talos/worktrees/a1b2c3d4/thurb` has spent every
--- column it had on boilerplate and cut off the only part that identifies the
--- repository. Falls back to end-truncation below eight columns, where there is
--- not room for two halves and an ellipsis.
function widgets.middle_truncate(str, width)
  if width < 8 then
    return text.truncate(str, width)
  end
  return text.truncate(str, width, { side = "middle" })
end

--- Pad `str` out to `width` columns.
function widgets.pad(str, width)
  return text.pad(str, width)
end

--- A row's text as a LIST of spans, whatever shape it arrived in.
---
--- A row may carry a bare string, one span table, or a list of them — three
--- spellings that were previously branched on at the point of use, where the
--- value's type had to be re-derived from whether it had a `text` field. Doing it
--- once here means the loop below sees one shape, and a type checker can follow
--- it (`lua-language-server` could not: it inferred the list and then flagged the
--- `.text` probe as an undefined field).
---@param spans string|table
---@return table[]
local function span_list(spans)

end

--- An overflow marker: a row of its own, never drawn over one.
local function overflow_marker(label)
  return { type = "text", len = 1, text = theme.dim(label), role = "overflow" }
end

--- The visible window, plus which overflow markers fit beside it.
---
--- A marker is a row, so it costs a line the rows would otherwise have had —
--- and giving up that line can push a further row out of view, which calls for
--- the second marker too. Hence two passes rather than one subtraction.
---
--- What comes back is always a sub-range of `widgets.window` for the same
--- height, which is what lets a pane build spans against that wider window and
--- know the list reads no row it skipped.
---
--- A list with no line to spare — one or two rows with both ends hidden —
--- shows rows and no markers: a strip made entirely of "N more" says nothing.

--- A scrollable list of rows.
---
--- Each row is `{ spans = <text>, id =, class =, role = }` or a plain string.
--- Rows get identity by default (`role = "row"`), so decoration and event
--- targeting work without every pane opting in.
---
--- `len` and `fill` size the returned box. A caller that had to patch a size
--- onto the table after the call was reaching for the one prop the widget could
--- not express.
---
--- `selected_style` and `hover_style` are the row's own `style`, which the
--- kernel paints across its whole rect before the spans go on top. That is a
--- full-width bar with no spacer span to pad it and no style merged into every
--- span by hand — and a span that names its own colour keeps it, so a search
--- highlight stays visible under the bar. `hover_style` is matched on `row.id`
--- and skipped on the selected row, which already wears the stronger one, and
--- on a row marked `hover = false` — a heading that has an id only so a click
--- on it resolves to nothing must not light up as if it did something.
