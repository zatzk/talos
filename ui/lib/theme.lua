-- Theme roles.
--
-- This file carries NO colour values. It reads the palette the kernel resolved
-- from the built-in presets, your themes.toml and your persisted choice — the
-- same three sources v1 used, so your themes and your current selection carry
-- over untouched.
--
-- That is the whole contract: a plugin names a ROLE, never a colour. Change the
-- active theme and every pane restyles at once, including panes whose author
-- never heard of your theme. A plugin that hardcodes "#5fafff" opts out of all
-- of that, which is why nothing here hands one out.

--- Declared so the shorthands the metatable serves are checkable: `__index`
--- answers nil for a name it does not know, so without this a misspelt one is a
--- run that renders in the terminal's default colour and looks deliberate. The
--- full role vocabulary is `talos.Role` in `talos.d.lua`; these are the
--- short names, and the two are kept in step by SHORTHAND below.

--- which is at rest by definition. It is deliberately NOT how the three
--- silences are drawn: `running`, `uncovered` and `unreported` each have a row

theme.spinner = { "⠋", "⠙", "⠹", "⠸", "⠼", "⠴", "⠦", "⠧", "⠇", "⠏" }

--- The spinner glyph for this frame.
---
--- Here rather than in `lib/widgets.lua` so that it ships in the same file as
--- the table it indexes. A pane and a `lib/` module are delivered separately and
--- an edit to either is preserved, so a directory can carry an updated pane
--- beside a module predating a helper it calls; the call then throws from
--- `render`, and a pane that throws records no click targets, so its rows stop
--- answering the mouse. Nothing makes a pane immune to a stale module — but the
--- glyphs and the arithmetic over them can at least not skew against each
--- other.
---
--- The 8 is the kernel's `ANIMATION_HZ` (`kernel::host`), and the two must stay
--- in lockstep: the shared animation clock invalidates `pure` panes at that rate
--- and only while something is animating, so a spinner advancing faster than the
--- clock would skip frames and one advancing slower would be re-rendered for no
--- visible change.
