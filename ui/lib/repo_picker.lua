-- The repo picker's row model: which remembered repositories to draw, and

-- Pure functions over the published bookmark rows and the flow's own choices —
-- the creation flow passes both in, so nothing here reads the snapshot or the
-- flow's other state. Matching is `lib.fuzzy`, the same subsequence match the
-- search strip and the session list use, so the three cannot disagree about
-- what a query hits.

--- The rows to draw, in order: every published row, minus the children of a
--- collapsed parent — or, while searching, the matching repositories ranked
--- best first (see `rank`).
---
--- A search expands every group, as v1's does — a match hidden inside a
--- collapsed folder would be unfindable — and leaves the headers out: the
--- ranked list is flat, and a header is a folder rather than a pick.
---
--- Memoized: a single keystroke can ask for the rows several times (the
--- renderer, the cursor lookup in three action branches, the click resolver),
--- and each walk fuzzy-matches every bookmark. The published rows are a gated
--- group, so their table identity keys the memo; the collapsed set is tiny and
--- digested by value because `state` hands back a fresh table on every read.
