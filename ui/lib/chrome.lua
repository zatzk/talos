-- What the full-height panes agree on about their borders.
--
-- The borders themselves are ordinary kernel `frame`s. They were once drawn by
-- hand, out of `text` nodes and a cell buffer, because a frame's title was a
-- plain unstyled left-aligned string and there was no way to put anything else
-- on a border cell. A frame now takes styled title runs, a `title_align`, a
-- `border_type` and an `overlay` — the strip, the scroll counts and the
-- scrollbar all paint onto the border cells the block drew — so the cell buffer
-- and the framed-pane builder are gone and what is left here is the agreement:
-- how a pane's border and title say whether it has focus — reached through
-- `lib/ui`'s `ui.panel` for a pane that uses the component layer, and directly by
-- the agent pane, which still assembles its own frame — and the box-drawing set
-- the agent pane's hint box draws by hand because it is a box INSIDE a pane, not
-- a frame around one.

-- ── Focus styling ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- One question every pane has to answer the same way: which one has the keys?
-- The answer is carried three ways at once, so it survives any one of them
-- being lost:
--
--   * the SHAPE of the border — thick for the focused pane, thin for the rest;
--   * a MARK and a BADGE on the title — ` ▸ Title `, bold, on a filled field;
--   * COLOUR — the theme's `border_focused` and `border_unfocused` roles.
--
-- The first two are what a monochrome terminal, a colour-blind reader and a
-- low-contrast theme are left with, which is why colour is the last of the
-- three rather than the only one. v1 drew the focused border thick as well.
--
-- The kernel publishes a single `focused` boolean and `chrome.level` maps it
-- to one of three levels. Unfocused is `inactive`: a quiet border in the
-- theme's own unfocused role, so the one accented frame on screen is the one
-- with focus. `active` (thin, accent) is kept for a pane that wants to stay
-- lit without focus — an edited pane from an older release asks for it by
-- name — but no bundled pane does: an accent on two frames at once is what
-- made "which one has focus?" a question in the first place.

--- The mark a focused pane's title carries. U+25B8, a narrow glyph in every
--- East Asian width table, so it costs one column wherever it is drawn.
chrome.MARK = "▸"

  return { fg = theme.border }
end

--- v1's `ui::title_style` / `Theme::focused_title()`. Focused is a BADGE —

--- brighter text colour, so the title and the frame around it agree.
